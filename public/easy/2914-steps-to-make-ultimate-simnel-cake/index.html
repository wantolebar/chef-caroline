<p><i>Before you jump to Simnel cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i></p>
<p>You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn&rsquo;t always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Working out at the gym isn&rsquo;t something people make time for when they get off from work. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that getting healthy doesn&rsquo;t have to be hard. If you are conscientious you&rsquo;ll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.</p>
<p>Consider the stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Most people will decide to be idle and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise.</p>
<p>There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need to help to make your body as strong it can be.</p>
<p><i>We hope you got benefit from reading it, now let&rsquo;s go back to simnel cake recipe. To cook simnel cake you only need <strong>30</strong> ingredients and <strong>10</strong> steps. Here is how you cook that.
</i></p>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-prepare-simnel-cake">The ingredients needed to prepare Simnel cake:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare  For the marzipan:</li>
<li>Use 100 g ground almonds</li>
<li>Take 100 g icing sugar, plus extra to dust</li>
<li>Take 2 free-range egg yolks</li>
<li>You need 2 tbsp. lemon juice</li>
<li>Use  For the cake:</li>
<li>Take 5 tbsp. milk</li>
<li>Take 1 good pinch of saffron</li>
<li>Take 150 g raisins</li>
<li>Get 150 g sultanas</li>
<li>Provide 40 g brandy, vin santo or white rum</li>
<li>Prepare 50 g bleached almonds</li>
<li>Use 175 g plain flour</li>
<li>You need 1 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>Use 45 g ground almonds</li>
<li>Take 1/2 tsp fine salt</li>
<li>Take 2 tsp mixed spice</li>
<li>You need 180 g butter, at room temperature</li>
<li>Prepare 180 g soft, light brown sugar</li>
<li>Prepare 3 eggs</li>
<li>Use 1 tbsp. golden syrup</li>
<li>Take  zest of 1 lemon and 1 orange</li>
<li>Provide 50 g glacé cherries, halved</li>
<li>You need 50 g mixed peel</li>
<li>Provide  apricot jam, to brush over the cake</li>
<li>Take  For the icing:</li>
<li>Take 30 g caster sugar</li>
<li>Use 25 g butter</li>
<li>You need 20 g lemon juice</li>
<li>You need 110 g icing sugar</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-simnel-cake">Steps to make Simnel cake:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Put the raisins and sultanas in a mixing bowl or a small zip lock bag. Heat up the spirits to almost boiling, pour it into the fruit and mix well. Seal the bag or cover the bowl and leave for a few hours, best overnight, to soak.</li>
<li>Butter and line with parchment a 20cm deep cake tin. Prepare another disc of parchment the size of the tin to place on top of the cake, to stop it from burning. Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas 2.</li>
<li>Warm up the milk and put the saffron strands into it to soak. Toast the almonds in a dry frying pan or in hot oven on a baking tray for 10-15 minutes until they turn golden. Cool and chop roughly.</li>
<li>Mix the flour with the baking powder, ground almonds, salt and mixed spice and put to one side. Beat the butter in an electric mixer, add the sugar and beat well until the mixture turns pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating continuously, alternating with a little flour mix. Beat in the rest of the flour, golden syrup, zest and the milk with saffron.</li>
<li>Drain the soaked fruit if necessary – but all the liquid should have been absorbed. Stir them into the cake batter together with the chopped almonds, peel and glace cherries.</li>
<li>Take the marzipan out of the fridge and roll it out on a surface dusted with icing sugar to a disc the size of your tin. Spoon half the cake batter into the tin, place the marzipan disc in and spoon the rest of the cake mix on top.</li>
<li>Smooth the surface with a spatula and place the parchment disc on top.</li>
<li>Bake the cake for about 1 ¾ - 2 hours until a skewer inserted in the middle (not too deep because of the marzipan layer) comes out clean. Cool in the tin, unmould and brush the top and sides with the apricot jam warmed up slightly in a small pan.</li>
<li>To make the icing, bring the butter, caster sugar and lemon juice to the boiling point then pour over the icing sugar. Whisk to a smooth paste, add some yellow food colouring for extra Easter cheer.</li>
<li>Spread the icing over the top of the cake with a palette knife, making sure no crumbs mix into the icing and spoil the effect. Leave to set.</li>
