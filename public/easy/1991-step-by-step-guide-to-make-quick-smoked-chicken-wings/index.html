<p><i>Before you jump to Smoked Chicken Wings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br></p>
<p>It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won&rsquo;t be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.</p>
<p>Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as efficiently as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won&rsquo;t have to go as often.</p>
<p>The kitchen alone gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, after all. It&rsquo;s related to being practical, usually.</p>
<p><i>We hope you got insight from reading it, now let&rsquo;s go back to smoked chicken wings recipe. To make smoked chicken wings you need <strong>13</strong> ingredients and <strong>9</strong> steps. Here is how you cook it.
</i></p>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-prepare-smoked-chicken-wings">The ingredients needed to prepare Smoked Chicken Wings:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get 20 IQF Chicken Wings</li>
<li>Get  AP Rub*</li>
<li>Use 1 Cup Salt</li>
<li>Take 1/2 Cup Garlic Granulated</li>
<li>Prepare 1/4 Pepper</li>
<li>Get  Rub Mix*</li>
<li>Get 2 tbsp Garlic Granulated</li>
<li>Get 2 tbsp White Sugar</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tbsp Paprika</li>
<li>Get  Sauces*</li>
<li>Provide  BBQ Sauce</li>
<li>Get  Hot Sauce</li>
<li>You need  Teriyaki Sauce</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-smoked-chicken-wings">Instructions to make Smoked Chicken Wings:</h5>
<ol>
<li>3 days before cooking divide the wing quantity in half to thaw. Put 10 wings per gallon sized bag with 2 tbsp of the AP rub. As the wings thaw the ice will melt and mix with the rub and act as a brine.</li>
<li>Heat smoker to 275° F. I used a combination of charcoal and pecan wood.</li>
<li>Pat the wings dry and dust both sides with the rub mix. I didn't use a traditional style BBQ rub or my personal chicken rub mix recipe. I wanted them to have a lighter flavor and less of a bark than a brown sugar based rub gives so the sauces could act as the glaze.</li>
<li>Let sit for just few minutes with the rub before putting on the smoker.</li>
<li>Smoke them for 1 hour.</li>
<li>Put the teriyaki sauce in a small bowl and in another bowl mix 2 parts BBQ sauce and 1 part hot sauce. Let these come to room temperature. I did 10 teriyaki and 10 hot bbq.</li>
<li>After an hour flip and let cook for another half hour.</li>
<li>Flip again and sauce. After 10 minutes flip and sauce the other side.</li>
<li>Let them cook for another 10-15 minutes. The light rub will set and add a slight crispness like if fried. The sauce will be thick and smokey.</li>
</ol>
