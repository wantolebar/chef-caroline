<p><i>Before you jump to Fruity moist chocolate cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i></p>
<p>You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don&rsquo;t always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn&rsquo;t have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you&rsquo;ll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.</p>
<p>Go up the stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise.</p>
<p>There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done each day, can do plenty to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don&rsquo;t overlook that health isn&rsquo;t only about simply how much you weigh. It is more about making your body as sturdy as it can be.</p>

</ol>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-fruity-moist-chocolate-cake">Instructions to make Fruity moist chocolate cake:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour two 9-inch baking pans (or line with parchment paper circles) and set aside.</li>
<li>In the large bowl of a standing mixer, stir together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. Add eggs, buttermilk, melted butter and vanilla extract and beat until smooth (about 3 minutes). Remove bowl from mixer and stir in hot coffee with a rubber spatula. Batter will be very runny.</li>

Wearing oven mitts, use both hands to hold the racks in place while flipping the cakes over onto the racks. Set the racks down and gently thump on the bottom of the pans until the cakes release. Cool completely before handling or frosting.</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl Combine your (powdered whipping cream,icing sugar and milk)beat until the cream holds soft peaks and set aside</li>
<li>For the fruity glaze</li>
<li>Mix the strawberry jam with hot water</li>
<li>Pour over the fruits and mix well</li>
<li>Using a palette knife rub the whipped cream on your cake board</li>
<li>Drizzle the strawberry jam mixture over the first layer and using a piping bag filled with any nozzle of your choice go round the edge of it</li>
<li>And spread then you pour the fruity mixture leaving 1inch boarder for decorating</li>
<li>Using your filled piping bag and make some frosting aroud the edges</li>
<li>Serve right away or keep refrigerated</li>
<li></li>
