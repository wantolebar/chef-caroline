<p><i>Before you jump to Bread lasagna recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br></p>
<p>Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.</p>
<p>Begin with exchanging the lights. Complete this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. You really need to upgrade your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. You also have to obtain the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This also happens in the rest of the house, but we are trying to save money in the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.</p>
<p>The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn&rsquo;t that hard. A lot of it is simply using common sense.</p>
<p><i>We hope you got benefit from reading it, now let&rsquo;s go back to bread lasagna recipe. To cook bread lasagna you need <strong>35</strong> ingredients and <strong>10</strong> steps. Here is how you do that.

</ol>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-bread-lasagna">Instructions to make Bread lasagna:</h5>
<ol>
<li>For White sauce: Keep a nonstick pan at low flame. Now add butter, once butter melts add maida and mix well on low heat. Now add milk and mix well. Add sugar, oregano, chilli flakes and mix well. Stir for 2-3 seconds and keep aside.</li>
<li></li>
<li>For Red sauce:Boil tomatoes until tender. Cool them down. Remove the outer skin and then add 1/4 cup water and blend it and prepare tomato puree.</li>
<li>Now on the same pan, add chopped garlic and ginger and saute for few seconds. Add tomato puree and mix well. Now add salt, sugar, chilli flakes, chilli powder and stir on low flame until raw smell is gone from tomato. Keep aside.</li>
<li>For Vegetable filling:In the same pan, add oil and chopped garlic and ginger then saute for few seconds. Add chopped onions, chopped potato and boiled corn. Now add salt, tomato ketchup, chilli flakes and cook it for few seconds until all the vegetables are 3/4th cooked. You can add the vegetables as per your choice.</li>
<li>For Assembling: Remove the brown sides from all the bread slices and keep aside. You can make the bread slices little thinner using rolling pin. I haven't done that, I used the bread slices as it is by only removing the hard edges.</li>
<li>Take a baking tray or container. Spread the white sauce and red sauce and then keep the bread slices on top of it as 2nd layer as shown in picture.</li>
<li>Now apply red and white sauce again and layer it up with vegetable filling we prepared. Then add both mozzarella and processed cheese and little bit of white sauce.</li>
<li>Now again layer it up with another layer of breads. Then spread some red and white sauce. And finally add remaining cheese on top of it. Sprinkle chilli flakes, crushed black pepper, oregano, few corns and little bit of red sauce.</li>
<li>Preheat the microwave in convection mode for 5 mins (180°C). Then bake for 10-15 minutes in 180°C tempreture.After 10-15 minutes your yummy delicious cheesy lasagna will be ready to serve.</li>
