<p><i>Before you jump to Stollen recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i></p>
<p>Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don&rsquo;t always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn&rsquo;t have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.</p>
<p>When you go to the grocery store, be smart about it. If you make smart decisions when you are purchasing your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think for a second: you don&rsquo;t want to go to a chaotic grocery store or sit in a lengthy line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to go to your house and make a little something from your kitchen. Fill your cupboards with wholesome foods. This makes it simple to have a great meal&ndash;even if you want something junky&ndash;because you&rsquo;ll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you&rsquo;d buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.</p>
<p>There are many things you can do to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren&rsquo;t the only indicator of your lifestyle choices. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.</p>
<p><i>We hope you got benefit from reading it, now let&rsquo;s go back to stollen recipe. You can cook stollen using <strong>16</strong> ingredients and <strong>9</strong> steps. Here is how you do that.
</i></p>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-stollen">The ingredients needed to make Stollen:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Use 500 g All-Purpose Flour</li>
<li>Prepare 100 g Caster Sugar</li>
<li>You need 150 g butter, softened</li>
<li>You need 1 egg + 1 egg yolk</li>
<li>You need 100 g sourdough starter</li>
<li>Take 200 ml Whole Milk</li>
<li>You need 0.5 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>You need 2 drops almond extract</li>
<li>You need 2 pinches mixed spice</li>
<li>Use 7 g salt</li>
<li>Take 200 g raisins/currants/dried blueberries etc</li>
<li>Prepare 80 g mixed candied peel</li>
<li>Use 100 ml cardamom coffee</li>
<li>Get 225 g Marzipan</li>
<li>Provide  melted butter</li>
<li>Get  icing sugar</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-stollen">Instructions to make Stollen:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make dough by mixing flour, sugar, starter, butter, egg, milk, vanilla extract, almond extract and mixed spice. Work into a dough and then knead for a bit. Work in the salt and then knead some more. 7 minutes kneading in total.</li>
<li>Leave to prove for 5hours at 20C. While it is proving, make a coffee. Not for you - we are going to soak the fruit in it. Ideally you want to make a double espresso with about 8 cardamom pods in it. (crack them, so liquid can get into the pods, but don't open them so the seeds fall out). Add the cardamom pods while the coffee is still hot, and then leave to sit at room temp for an hour or so.</li>
<li>Remove the cardamom pods from the coffee and pour the coffee into a bowl containing the raisins and the mixed peel. Stir occasionally over the course of the next few hours (while the dough is still proving).</li>
<li>Make Marzipan (unless you just bought it).</li>
<li>When the dough has finished proving (it might have doubled in size, don't worry if it hasn't quite) drain any excess liquid from the fruit and work it into the dough by doing a series of folds. This becomes quite hard work when there is a lot of fruit. Don't worry if you can't get it all into the dough.</li>
<li>When the fruit is evenly distributed, roll it flat to about 45cm x 35cm. Roll the Marzipan flat to 35cm x 20cm. place the Marzipan on top of the dough and roll it up so that you have a sausage-shaped loaf with a swirl of dough running through the centre. It should be quite big. Don't worry if there is exposed marzipan sticking out the end. This will turn into the most excellent burnt bits imaginable.</li>
<li>Leave to prove for another 2 hours.</li>
<li>Bake at 180C for 1 hr.</li>
<li>Poke holes in the dough using a cake tester, then melt butter onto the surface and try to work it into the holes. When the Stollen has cooled, dust with icing sugar.</li>
</ol>
