It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, nevertheless it will save you money to use it over your oven. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen alone gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that tough. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
