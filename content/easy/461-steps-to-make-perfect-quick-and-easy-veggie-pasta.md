<i>Before you jump to Quick and easy veggie pasta recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as economically as they should. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, after all. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
