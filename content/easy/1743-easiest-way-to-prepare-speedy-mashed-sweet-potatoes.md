Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as effectively as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.
