<i>Before you jump to Banana-vanilla ice cream recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as effectively as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is merely utilizing common sense.
