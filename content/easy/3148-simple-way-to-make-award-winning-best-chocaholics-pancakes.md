<i>Before you jump to Best Chocaholics Pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
