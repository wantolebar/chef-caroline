<i>Before you jump to Easy Pickled Cucumbers in 5 Minutes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as economically as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
