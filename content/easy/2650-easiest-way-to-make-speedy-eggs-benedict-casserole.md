<i>Before you jump to Eggs Benedict Casserole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
