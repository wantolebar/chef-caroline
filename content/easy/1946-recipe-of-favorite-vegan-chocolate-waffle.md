<i>Before you jump to Vegan chocolate waffle recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as effectively as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
