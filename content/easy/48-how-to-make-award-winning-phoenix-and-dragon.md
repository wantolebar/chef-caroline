<i>Before you jump to Phoenix and Dragon recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle involves. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Take the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the choices you make each day is a start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need your body to be powerful too.
