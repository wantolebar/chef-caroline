<i>Before you jump to Fattoush recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. A lot of it really is simply utilizing common sense.
