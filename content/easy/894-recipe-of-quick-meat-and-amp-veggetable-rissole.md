<i>Before you jump to Meat &amp; Veggetable Rissole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good an area to start as any. Complete this for the whole house, not just the kitchen. You need to change your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Utilizing these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than merely swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Of course this also happens in different rooms, not simply the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
