<i>Before you jump to Not Your Grandma&#39;s Lugaw Congee (Filipino Congee) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of electrical power is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that tough. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
