<i>Before you jump to Tortellini Chowder recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Let us begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more originally, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. It goes further than simply exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen area, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. Typically, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
