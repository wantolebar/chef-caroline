<i>Before you jump to Healthy detox chicken soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
