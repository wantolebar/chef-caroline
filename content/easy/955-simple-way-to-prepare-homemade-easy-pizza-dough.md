It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
