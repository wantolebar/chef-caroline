<i>Before you jump to Chicken Parmesan (vegetarian) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle involves. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Take the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get wholesome. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You want your body to be powerful too.
