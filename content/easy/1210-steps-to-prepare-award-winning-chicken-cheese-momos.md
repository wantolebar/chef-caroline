<i>Before you jump to Chicken Cheese Momos recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's concerning being functional, most of the time.
