Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a place to start as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen area. You need to replace your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more initially, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The family spends major time in the kitchen, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long.

Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. A lot of it truly is simply using common sense.
