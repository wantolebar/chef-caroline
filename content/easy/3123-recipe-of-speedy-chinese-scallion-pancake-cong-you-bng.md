recipeingredient:
- "4 cups flour"
- " Extra flour"
- "2 cups cold water"
- "1 cup hot water"
- " Salt"
- " Vegetable oil"
- "3 bundles green onionscallion"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the cold water and hot water together to create warm/lukewarm water. Mix this water slowly with the flour in a bowl and mix to create a wet dough. It should look shaggy and is a little bit sticky to the touch."
- "Once the flour is fully incorporated and there isn’t any dry spots or wet spots, form into a ball and rest in a bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp towel to keep it moist while you let it rise a little. Let it sit in room temperature for about 30 minutes."
- "While the dough rests, cut the green onion. Cut into thin slices."
- "Once the dough is rested, remove and place on a flour dusted workspace. Begin kneading the dough. This dough will take in a lot of flour so take extra flour and continue to dust, kneading and massaging until it isn’t sticky to the touch anymore."
- "On a flour dusted work surface, begin to roll the dough out into a nice round shape, ensuring that it is evenly flattened out. Make sure both sides of the dough are nicely floured so it doesn’t stick to the table or the rolling pin."
- "Sprinkle a generous amount of salt and oil over the surface of the dough. You can use your hand to spread the oil evenly or fold the dough over lightly and “squish” the two together to evenly distribute the oil and salt. Return dough to the rough shape."
- "Cover the surface of the dough with a generous amount of green onions."
- "Roll the dough, just like you would a cinnamon bun. Roll tightly."
- "Cut the log into evenly sized pieces."
- "Optional: pinch and squeeze the ends of each piece closed."
- "Generously flour both sides of the piece and place the cut side on the table. Flatten each piece into a large and thin circle, just like a pancake, but larger and thinner. Continually flour both sides so that it doesn’t stick. The flour also helps the roll not open up, but rather stick back together."
- "Once it is rolled out nice and thin (as thin as you can get it, but not crazy thin), you’re ready to cook it."
- "Place the pancake on a hot oiled frying pan on medium to medium high heat and cook eat side until nice and crisp and browned."
- "It’s ready to eat as soon as it comes off the frying pan. You can keep it whole and people can just tear it up when eating it, or you can cut it into quarter slices. Enjoy! This goes really well with other dishes, but some people eat this as a main dish. My family eats this as a side dish."

<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
