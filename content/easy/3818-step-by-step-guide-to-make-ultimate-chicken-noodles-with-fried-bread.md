That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money.

Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity.
