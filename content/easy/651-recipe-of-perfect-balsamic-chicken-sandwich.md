It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A massive amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that hard. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
