recipeingredient:
- " olive oil extra virgin"
- " onion minced"
- " carrot minced"
- " garlic minced"
- " red pepper flakes"
- " handful parsley chopped"
- " salt"
- " bread crumbs for stuffing"
- " marinara tomato sauce"
- " mozzarella cheese chopped"
- " pecorino Romano grated"
- " chicken breasts"
- " eggs lightly beaten"
- " bread crumbs for breading"
- " vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large 8 quart pot, put the olive oil on low heat."
- "Add the onions, carrot, garlic, parsley, red pepper flakes, and salt, and cook until the onions are translucent."
- "Mix in the stuffing bread crumbs.  I used the boxed sandy kind."
- "Add the tomato sauce, and stir it together into a moldable stuffing.  A good homemade sauce is ideal."
- "Add the Romano and mozzarella, and stir it in."
- "Turn off the heat, and set it aside."
- "Here&#39;s the bit you&#39;ll just love.  Lay a breast smooth side up, and cut, ultra-thin, horizontally into layers.  A lot of really thin layers.  Then, literally, cut those layers into inch thick ribbons.  Repeat for all the breasts.  That&#39;s not tedious at all, right?  Set aside."
- "Make a bowl of breading bread crumbs and a bowl of egg.  The egg amount I listed is pretty close to spot on, but the breading amount is an estimate."
- "Fill a large wok with vegetable oil at least a third, and get it up to sizzling on medium high."
- "OK, here&#39;s the Henry Ford stuff.  Grab a lump of stuffing and wrap it in a chicken ribbon such that no stuffing is peeking out.  You get a feel for the lump size after a few.  Then, dip the lump into egg, and then coat with crumbs and toss into the wok.  NOTE: actually tossing them in is a bad idea, easing them in results in fewer blistering burns."
- "You are looking for a deep brown color, like toast right before it is actually burnt.  Like a chocolate chip cookie that is a little dark.  This is important because you need to make sure the chicken is cooked.  If a little mozzarella pops out, that is OK by me, and also a good sign of thorough cooking."
- "Fish them out as they finish cooking and replace with new battered lumps.  Repeat until out of inventory."
- "Serve with marinara sauce.  Enjoy so so much!!!"

<i>Before you jump to Chicken Parm Poppers recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle demands. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesnâ€™t have to be a chore. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Drink water, not alternative drinks. Soda and coffee, when consumed in small amounts, aren't that bad. Using them for your only source of hydration, however, is dumb. Drinking water instead of other types of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. This also helps you lower your caloric intake by hundreds of points without needing to buy and eat gross diet foods. Water is often the key to successful weight reduction and healthfulness.

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. It has more to do with making your body as strong as it can be.
