<i>Before you jump to Granola bar choco filled mango pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as effectively as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
