recipeinstructions:
- "I use gf chicken bouillon powder and water to make the stock needed for this. I add an extra few tsps of powder to compensate for the extra liquid that you&#39;ll add to the main recipe you&#39;re making the soup for. Knorr brand Stock Cubes are free-from lactose and you can crumble those up if you can&#39;t find their tubs of bouillon. If you don&#39;t use strong stock I find the flavour is too diluted in the main dish"
- "Put the stock and the rice milk (or any milk you prefer) in a pan and bring to the boil"
- "Mix the flour, seasonings and herbs with the coconut milk (or any milk you prefer) until you have a thick mixture"
- "Turn down the heat then add the flour mixture slowly to the pan, whisking continuously"
- "Keep whisking off the heat for a good 3 - 5 minutes to break up any lumps and smooth the soup while the flour flavour cooks out"
- "You can add cooked, chopped chicken if you like or cooked &amp; chopped mushroom or celery to make cream of those soups, around 50 - 60 grams"
- "This recipe will make the equivalent of 2 cans of CONDENSED soup that you can use in recipes where a can of condensed cream soup is an ingredient. You can halve it if desired"

<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

You may possibly prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being practical, most of the time.
