Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Let's begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Making use of these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Along with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly discover members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house at the same time. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
