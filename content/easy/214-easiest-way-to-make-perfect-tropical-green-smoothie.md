<i>Before you jump to Tropical Green Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as effectively as they should. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
