It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
