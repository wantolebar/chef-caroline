- " Decoration"
- "1 egg beaten for glazing before baking"
- " pearl sugar to sprinkle on top"
- " Syrup"
- "150 ml water"

recipeinstructions:
- "Start by making the dough: add the yeast, flour, salt, cardamom and sugar to a large bowl. In a separate container beat together the milk and egg. (To speed up rising you can microwave the milk/egg mixture until lukewarm — approx 35 degrees celsius.)"
- "Pour the egg/milk mixture into the flour mixture and mix until roughly combined using your hands, or a stand mixer with a dough hook. Mix in the butter gradually in 3 or 4 stages. Knead the dough for 10 minutes to develop the gluten. (Initially mixture will be quite sticky, but after a minute or so it should become a smooth dough. Sprinkle on some extra flour if it seems too sticky to Knead.)"
- "Put the dough back into the bowl, cover and leave somewhere warm for 20 minutes for a first rise."
- "Meanwhile, make the cinnamon filling: add the marzipan/almond &amp; sugar, cinnamon, vanilla sugar/sugar &amp; vanilla and butter to a bowl. Beat together until well combined and smooth."
- "Finish the dough: Sprinkle some flour on a worktop and turn out the dough onto it. Pat the dough into a rough flat rectangle, then roll out with a floured rolling pin to a 3–4mm thick rectangle, a little taller than wide. Spread the cinnamon mixture evenly over the dough, then fold the dough in half (cinnamon inside, short edge to short edge). You should have a rectangle of dough roughly twice as wide as it is tall."
- "Slice the dough: Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice your dough rectangle into strips about 1cm wide, or according to the number of buns you want. (Slice from the edge opposite the fold towards the fold. I.e. slice from the long edge of your rectangle to create more short strips rather than fewer long strips.)"
- "Assemble the buns: To make the buns we coil a strip of dough around two fingers held slightly apart in a Bhi shape. Take a strip of dough, hold each end and gently shake and stretch it to about 30–40cm long. (If the strip is uneven, stretch wider parts more.) Holding one end of the strip between your thumb and one of the two fingers, begin coiling the strip around the two fingers. Wrap at least twice, ideally 3 or 4+ times. Each coil should create a twist in the strip...."
- "... After the coils, wrap the strip around the coil in the opposite direction once or twice with the strip ending on the underside. (This is decorative but also holds the coil together.) Slightly pinch the end of the strip into the bun to secure it. Place the bun on a baking tray lined with baking paper. Repeat with the rest of the strips."
- "Rising the dough: (You can delay at this point by refrigerating the un-risen buns overnight before continuing with the rising in the morning.) Place the baking trays in a warm place for 1–2 hours. The buns should roughly double in size."
- "(Tip: I use my oven to rise the dough: place the buns in a COLD oven with a digital instant-ready thermometer inside the oven so that you can see it though the door glass. Turn on the oven to the lowest temperature for 5–10 seconds at a time until the thermometer reads 35 celsius. Leave the oven off, but check the temperature every 20 minutes or so and re-warm as required.)"
- "Decorate before baking: Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees celsius (fan). Paint beaten egg over each bun with a pastry brush, then sprinkle with your pearl sugar.   Tip: You can make pearl sugar yourself, see: http://whilehewasnapping.com/2015/02/how-to-diy-pearl-sugar/"
- "Bake for about 10 minutes. I recommend watching the buns through your oven door from about 8 or 9 minutes and take them out as they develop a medium brown colour. There&#39;s quite small time window between undercooked and burnt! Transfer the cooked buns to a wire rack to cool after a few minutes."
- "Prepare the syrup: While the buns are cooking add the sugar and water to a sauce pan (ideally with a heavy base) and place the pan over a medium–high heat. Once the mixture starts to boil, stir it every 30 seconds or so. After a few minutes it should thicken a little into a runny syrup. Take it off the heat. (Note that it should not caramelise — if it does you&#39;ve heated it too much.)"
- "Paint the warm syrup over the warm buns on the cooling rack."

<i>Before you jump to Kanelbullar — Swedish cinnamon buns recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is finished, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.

Go up the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an attempt on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are plenty of things you can do to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. You need to help to make your body as strong you can make it.

##### Steps to make Kanelbullar — Swedish cinnamon buns:

1. Start by making the dough: add the yeast, flour, salt, cardamom and sugar to a large bowl. In a separate container beat together the milk and egg. (To speed up rising you can microwave the milk/egg mixture until lukewarm — approx 35 degrees celsius.)
1. Pour the egg/milk mixture into the flour mixture and mix until roughly combined using your hands, or a stand mixer with a dough hook. Mix in the butter gradually in 3 or 4 stages. Knead the dough for 10 minutes to develop the gluten. (Initially mixture will be quite sticky, but after a minute or so it should become a smooth dough. Sprinkle on some extra flour if it seems too sticky to Knead.)
1. Put the dough back into the bowl, cover and leave somewhere warm for 20 minutes for a first rise.
1. Meanwhile, make the cinnamon filling: add the marzipan/almond &amp; sugar, cinnamon, vanilla sugar/sugar &amp; vanilla and butter to a bowl. Beat together until well combined and smooth.
1. Finish the dough: Sprinkle some flour on a worktop and turn out the dough onto it. Pat the dough into a rough flat rectangle, then roll out with a floured rolling pin to a 3–4mm thick rectangle, a little taller than wide. Spread the cinnamon mixture evenly over the dough, then fold the dough in half (cinnamon inside, short edge to short edge). You should have a rectangle of dough roughly twice as wide as it is tall.
1. Slice the dough: Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice your dough rectangle into strips about 1cm wide, or according to the number of buns you want. (Slice from the edge opposite the fold towards the fold. I.e. slice from the long edge of your rectangle to create more short strips rather than fewer long strips.)
1. Assemble the buns: To make the buns we coil a strip of dough around two fingers held slightly apart in a Bhi shape. Take a strip of dough, hold each end and gently shake and stretch it to about 30–40cm long. (If the strip is uneven, stretch wider parts more.) Holding one end of the strip between your thumb and one of the two fingers, begin coiling the strip around the two fingers. Wrap at least twice, ideally 3 or 4+ times. Each coil should create a twist in the strip....
1. ... After the coils, wrap the strip around the coil in the opposite direction once or twice with the strip ending on the underside. (This is decorative but also holds the coil together.) Slightly pinch the end of the strip into the bun to secure it. Place the bun on a baking tray lined with baking paper. Repeat with the rest of the strips.
1. Rising the dough: (You can delay at this point by refrigerating the un-risen buns overnight before continuing with the rising in the morning.) Place the baking trays in a warm place for 1–2 hours. The buns should roughly double in size.
1. (Tip: I use my oven to rise the dough: place the buns in a COLD oven with a digital instant-ready thermometer inside the oven so that you can see it though the door glass. Turn on the oven to the lowest temperature for 5–10 seconds at a time until the thermometer reads 35 celsius.

1. Decorate before baking: Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees celsius (fan). Paint beaten egg over each bun with a pastry brush, then sprinkle with your pearl sugar.  -  - Tip: You can make pearl sugar yourself, see: http://whilehewasnapping.com/2015/02/how-to-diy-pearl-sugar/
1. Bake for about 10 minutes. I recommend watching the buns through your oven door from about 8 or 9 minutes and take them out as they develop a medium brown colour. There&#39;s quite small time window between undercooked and burnt! Transfer the cooked buns to a wire rack to cool after a few minutes.
1. Prepare the syrup: While the buns are cooking add the sugar and water to a sauce pan (ideally with a heavy base) and place the pan over a medium–high heat. Once the mixture starts to boil, stir it every 30 seconds or so. After a few minutes it should thicken a little into a runny syrup. Take it off the heat. (Note that it should not caramelise — if it does you&#39;ve heated it too much.)
1. Paint the warm syrup over the warm buns on the cooling rack.
