<i>Before you jump to Edamame &amp; Avocado Dip recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Consider the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even just a individual flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. It is more about making your body as powerful as it can be.
