<i>Before you jump to 4S (Simple yet Sweet, Soft Scone) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Begin with replacing the lights. Accomplish this for the whole house, not merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights especially will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
