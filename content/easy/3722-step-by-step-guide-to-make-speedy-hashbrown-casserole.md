<i>Before you jump to Hashbrown casserole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. It's about being sensible, usually.
