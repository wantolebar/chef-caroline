<i>Before you jump to Shrimp-Scallops &amp; Mushroom Fettuccine recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
