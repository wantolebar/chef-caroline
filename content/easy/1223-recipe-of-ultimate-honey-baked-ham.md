- "1 ham"
- "1 packages brown sugar I use dark"
- "1 cup honey"
- "1 tbsp ground cloves"
- "1 pinch ground nutmeg"
- "1 stick butter"
- "2 cup apple juice or cider"
recipeinstructions:
- "You will want to cut (score) your ham. Your knife cuts should he about half inch deep. Cut across at angel from both sides to make diamond shapes. Place ham in preheated oven at 400 for 25 mins. While ham is in the oven,  mix all ingredients into a bowl and will make a paste like glaze. After the 25 mins, remove ham and apply thick glaze all over ham. use a basting brush and coat well. Place back in oven for 25 mins on 350. Repeat these steps as often as you like. I do it 7 or 8 times. Once done, you then take brown sugar and rub and pat evenly all over the ham and then take a blow torch to the ham all over. As you do this you will see the brown sugar buble and brown which then crystalizes it. This will provide the crisp/hard sweet sugar top coat like a honey baked ham. I cover and place in fridge over night and serve cold, but you can serve warm. What ever you like. Best ham I have ever had. You can garnish however you like, fresh fruit, veggies, again what ever you like."

<i>Before you jump to Honey Baked Ham recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Make smart decisions when grocery shopping. When you make informed and wise purchases at the grocery store, your meals will get much healthier immediately. Think for a second: you don't want to go to a busy grocery store or sit in a lengthy line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to go to your apartment and make something from your kitchen. Make sure that what you have on hand is healthful. This makes it easy to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Trying to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. It has more to do with making your body as strong as it can be.
