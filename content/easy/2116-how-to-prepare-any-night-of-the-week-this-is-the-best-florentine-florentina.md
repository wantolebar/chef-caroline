<i>Before you jump to This is the Best Florentine (Florentina) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as economically as they should. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. It's about being practical, more often than not.
