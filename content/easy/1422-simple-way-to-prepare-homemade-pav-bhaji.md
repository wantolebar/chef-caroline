<i>Before you jump to Pav bhaji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is finished, most people do not wish to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Be wise when you do your food shopping. Making good decisions when shopping for food means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. At the end of your day do you really want to deal with packed grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to go to your apartment and make something from your kitchen. Fill your pantry shelves with healthy foods. This way—even if you pick out something slightly greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still selecting foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your healthfulness. It is more about making your body as strong as it can be.
