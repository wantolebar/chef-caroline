<i>Before you jump to Poached egg in a tomato (🍅)cup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Climb stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. You need to help to make your body as strong it can be.
