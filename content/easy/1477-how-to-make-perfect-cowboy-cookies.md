<i>Before you jump to Cowboy Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
