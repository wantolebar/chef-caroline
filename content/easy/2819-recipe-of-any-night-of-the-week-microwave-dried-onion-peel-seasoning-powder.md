- "The second option is the one I used: microwaving. Peel the onion. We are going to use its peel and the first thick layer. Put the peel on a kitchen paper towel. Put it in the microwave for ten minutes at a very low temperature (30% power)."
- "Cut the thick layer into thin strips. Put them on a kitchen paper towel. Put them in the microwave for twenty minutes at a very low temperature (30% power). After ten minutes, flip the layers. How do you know they are already cooked? They need to be crunchy. If they are not crispy enough, put them on a baking dish in the oven at a medium temperature for 5 minutes."

<i>Before you jump to Microwave-Dried Onion Peel Seasoning Powder recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle involves. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy.

Run the stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. Don't ignore that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
