recipeingredient:
- "1 pound very ripe Mission Figs stemmed and quartered"
- "3/4 cup sugar to start you may like it sweeter  I tend to like my jams a little less sweet than the average storebought"
- "1/3 cup water"
- "2 Tablespoons maple syrup or honey"
- "1 Tablespoon lemon juice"
- "1 pinch kosher salt a little less than 18 teaspoon"
- "1-2 Tablespoons grated fresh ginger depending on how gingery you like things I find 1 Tablespoon subtle but detectible"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place all the ingredients but ginger in a large saucepan, give them a couple of good stirs and place on medium heat until all the sugar melts."
- "Let the mixture come to a very gentle boil for 2 minutes or so before giving the jam a few good stirs and turning the heat down to not quite medium low."
- "Let the jam very gently simmer and reduce (that means barely detectible movement on the surface with the very occasional slow bubble), uncovered, for anywhere from 45 to 60 minutes, depending on how thick you like your jam."
- "At the halfway mark (about 20 to 25 minutes into the simmer) mash the jam with a potato masher or a fork to the desired consistency, and stir in the ginger. Continue to simmer another 20 to 35 minutes, stirring occasionally - every 10 minutes or so should be good. Never let the heat get so high that you can scrape solids from the bottom of your cooking vessel. This will result in an oddly iron-like flavor to downright burnt flavor if the heat is way too high."
- "Give the jam a taste, remembering that it&#39;ll always taste slightly sweeter when thoroughly cooled than it does warm. If needed, add a little more sugar or maple syrup or honey for sweetness, a tiny bit of salt if the sweetness still tastes flat, or a teaspoonful of lemon juice if you want a little more tartness."
- "Let the jam cook another 5 minutes after you adjust the seasoning, cut the heat, give it a few good stirs, and let it cool thoroughly, uncovered (you don&#39;t want condensation to water down your jam, which will also make it more likely to spoil faster), before putting it in a container to refrigerate."
- "Enjoy! :)"

<i>Before you jump to Gingered Fig Jam recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Consider the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will decide to be lazy and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also critical. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your health levels. You need to make your body as strong you can make it.

</i>

##### The ingredients needed to cook Gingered Fig Jam:

1. Provide 1 pound very ripe Mission Figs, stemmed and quartered
1. Take 3/4 cup sugar to start (you may like it sweeter - I tend to like my jams a little less sweet than the average storebought)
1. Get 1/3 cup water
1. You need 2 Tablespoons maple syrup or honey
1. Use 1 Tablespoon lemon juice
1. Use 1 pinch kosher salt (a little less than 1/8 teaspoon)
1. Take 1-2 Tablespoons grated fresh ginger, depending on how gingery you like things. I find 1 Tablespoon subtle but detectible


##### Instructions to make Gingered Fig Jam:

1. Place all the ingredients but ginger in a large saucepan, give them a couple of good stirs and place on medium heat until all the sugar melts.
1. Let the mixture come to a very gentle boil for 2 minutes or so before giving the jam a few good stirs and turning the heat down to not quite medium low.
1. Let the jam very gently simmer and reduce (that means barely detectible movement on the surface with the very occasional slow bubble), uncovered, for anywhere from 45 to 60 minutes, depending on how thick you like your jam.
1. At the halfway mark (about 20 to 25 minutes into the simmer) mash the jam with a potato masher or a fork to the desired consistency, and stir in the ginger. Continue to simmer another 20 to 35 minutes, stirring occasionally - every 10 minutes or so should be good. Never let the heat get so high that you can scrape solids from the bottom of your cooking vessel. This will result in an oddly iron-like flavor to downright burnt flavor if the heat is way too high.
1. Give the jam a taste, remembering that it&#39;ll always taste slightly sweeter when thoroughly cooled than it does warm. If needed, add a little more sugar or maple syrup or honey for sweetness, a tiny bit of salt if the sweetness still tastes flat, or a teaspoonful of lemon juice if you want a little more tartness.
1. Let the jam cook another 5 minutes after you adjust the seasoning, cut the heat, give it a few good stirs, and let it cool thoroughly, uncovered (you don&#39;t want condensation to water down your jam, which will also make it more likely to spoil faster), before putting it in a container to refrigerate.
