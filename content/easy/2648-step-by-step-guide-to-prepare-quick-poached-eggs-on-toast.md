<i>Before you jump to Poached Eggs on ToastðŸ¥šðŸ¥ª recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
