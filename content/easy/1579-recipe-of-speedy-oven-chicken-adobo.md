It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many individuals wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being functional, usually.
