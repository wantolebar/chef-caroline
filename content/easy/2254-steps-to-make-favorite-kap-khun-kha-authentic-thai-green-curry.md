Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
