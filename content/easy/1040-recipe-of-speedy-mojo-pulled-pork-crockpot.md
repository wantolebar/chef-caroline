<i>Before you jump to Mojo Pulled Pork/crockpot recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, more often than not.
