<i>Before you jump to Hyderabadi chicken biriyani recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen. You need to change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Of course this also happens in different rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
