- "50 grams Rice flour"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 1/2 tsp Baking powder"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "1 tsp plus Vegetable oil"
- "1 enough to make a batter thats runnier than pancake batter Soy milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add all of the ingredients to a bowl and mix them together until smooth with a rubber spatula. The mixture should be quite creamy, and runnier than pancake batter."
- "Split the batter between 2 heat-resistant containers. We have these donut moulds at home so I&#39;m using those."
- "I used to use Ziploc containers for this step but have found it works best with thin plastic containers since then."
- "Heat the bread for 2 minutes in the microwave. Take the bread out and if the edges are still white and raw, heat them for a further 20 seconds."
- "Once the bread has been removed from the microwave, remove them from the moulds and place them on a wire rack to cool. If the steam sticks to the bread it will become wet and sticky."
- "Once the bread is cool enough to touch it&#39;s ready to eat Please only cut the bread with a knife once cooled, otherwise it may stick."
- "Addendum - If you reduce the amount of sugar and cut the bread in half you can use it to make hamburgers! With this recipe, all of my family members were finally able to eat hamburgers together."
- "Addendum - My friend says that this bread is even fluffier if you steam it in a steamer rather than a microwave."

<i>Before you jump to Simple Steamed Bread for People with Wheat, Dairy, or Egg Allergies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. Obviously this isnâ€™t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? So many people choose the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get wholesome. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Wanting to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You really want your body to be powerful too.
