<i>Before you jump to Oats Banana Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will decide to be idle and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also important. Don't ignore that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It has more to do with making your body as sturdy as it can be.
