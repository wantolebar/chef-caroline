Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
