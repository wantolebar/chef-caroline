<i>Before you jump to Easy Strawberry &#34;Crumble-Tart&#34; recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that difficult. Mostly, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
