<i>Before you jump to Methi vegetable recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Maybe the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
