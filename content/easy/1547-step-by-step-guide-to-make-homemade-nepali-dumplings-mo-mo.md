recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, put the meat and pour the oil on it."
- "In the meantime, put the onion, cilantro, and cabbage in a blender and blend it. The purpose is to chop it fine, and not a smooth paste. Once it is chopped finely in the blender, pour it in the bowl with the meat."
- "Add the remaining of the ingredients to the bowl and mix the entire mixture really well. (Hand mixing works best!)"
- "Let it marinate in the fridge while you prepare rest of the steps."
- "While the meat mixture is marinating, make the achaar (sauce). Chop the tomatoes and onions in quarters. Chop the cilantro bunch in half."

- "Once the tomatoes start to release juice, add the turmeric, salt, garlic, and ginger. Cook for another minute."
- "Add the cumin and cook for about 1 minute. Add the broth, lower heat, and summer it for about 5 minutes. If the broth in the mixture starts to evaporate and the mixture becomes dry, pour a little more broth. At the end of the 5 minutes, you would want the mixture to be a little brothy!"
- "Take the pot out of the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Then, pour all of the tomato mixture in a blender. Add the cilantro to the blender and blend really well."
- "Refrigerate the sauce while you follow the remaining steps for dumplings."
- "Set up the steamer and heat some water in the steamer base so that the water steam is ready. In the meantime, wrap the marinated meat mixture in the wraps."
- "Ideally, take a fork, and place a small fork-full of meat mixture in the center of the wrap. Rub some water on the edges of the wrap and seal all the edges together. Make sure that all corners and sealed. Repeat until you run out of the meat, or the wrap!"
- "Once the meat mixture has been wrapped and the water is boiling, put the Momos in the steamer and steam it for 20 minutes. If the steamer has two tiers, make sure that you switch the tiers at 10 minute mark, so that each tier of Momos are cooked properly."
- "Once cooked, remove the Momos from the steamer and serve immediately. To serve, add the desired amount of the Momos in a bowl and pour some chilled achaar over it."
- "Refrigerate the leftover Momos and achaar. Eat within 3 days."

<i>Before you jump to Nepali dumplings (Mo:Mo) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about slimming down. It’s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
