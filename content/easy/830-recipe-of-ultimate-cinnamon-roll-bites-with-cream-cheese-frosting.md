- "Take them out of oven and set aside to let them cool. While they are cooling, we&#39;ll make the frosting. (But if you prefer to drizzle when the cinnamon balls are hot, make the frosting while baking). Cooling makes the balls to keep crispness even after frosting."
- "Combine softened cream cheese, lemon juice, sugar, milk, and maple syrup(optional) in a bowl."
- "Mix well and check the consistency. You can use an electric hand mixer. But I just used a spatula. You can add more milk or cream cheese for your preferred consistency."
- "Drizzle it over the cinnamon balls."
- "(Secret) you can roll the balls and coat them with remained cinnamon coating mixture before frosting is dried! Extra sugary and yummy!"

<i>Before you jump to Cinnamon Roll Bites with Cream Cheese Frosting recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is complete, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Pick water over other refreshments. Sipping a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. Getting all of your hydration from them is a awful idea. Choosing water instead of other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories from your diet— without having to resort to terrible tasting diet food. Water is typically one of the keys to really slimming down and becoming really healthy.

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
