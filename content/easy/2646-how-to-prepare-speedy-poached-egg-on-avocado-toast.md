recipeingredient:
- "2 slices bread"
- "1 avocado"
- " Lemon juice"
- "2 egg"
- " Vinegar"
- " Salt"
- " Chilli flakes optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Toast the bread. I usually use a grill rather than a toaster to control the browning."
- "Carefully cut the avocado in half, remove the stone and scoop out the avocado flesh."
- "Add a little lemon juice to the avocado and mash to your desired constancy and set aside. The lemon is important, it stops the avocado from going off quickly."
- "Heat some water. As it comes to a boil, add some vinegar to the the water."
- "Secret technique - gently crack an egg into a sieve and allow the extra egg white to drain off. You&#39;ll notice that there is still an egg yolk and the main egg white. The extra egg white causes the stringing when you usually poach an egg. Once this is removed, you have a nice, smooth, bubble like raw egg ready for poaching."
- "Stir the boiling water to create a vortex and gently add the egg into the water. Boil for 3 minutes for a runny yolk. You can do two at a time, but I stick to 1 so they don’t interfere with one another. You may need to adjust your time to have your yolk to the consistency that you like."
- "Use a slotted spoon to fish out the egg and place on a kitchen towel to absorb any excess water."
- "Spread the avocado on the toast, add the poached egg, salt and pepper to taste and it’s ready to eat. Enjoy!"
- "Side note: My friend kept wanting to add chilli flakes to the avocado smash, but I’m not sure the flavour comes through. Have a go and see for yourself."

<i>Before you jump to Poached egg on avocado toast recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

Drink water, not alternative beverages. Soda and coffee, when ingested in moderation, aren't that bad. Using them for your sole source of hydration, however, is dumb. When you pick out water over other beverages you are helping your body remain very healthy and hydrated. This also helps you lower your caloric intake by hundreds of points without needing to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Water is often the key to successful weight-loss and healthfulness.

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about slimming down. It’s about making your body as strong as it can be.
