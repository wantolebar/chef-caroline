<i>Before you jump to Low FODMAP risotto and chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Go up the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every single day, can do plenty to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
