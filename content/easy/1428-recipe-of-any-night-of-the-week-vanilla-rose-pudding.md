Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. A lot of it really is merely utilizing common sense.
