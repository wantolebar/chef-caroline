<i>Before you jump to MOIST CHOCOLATE CAKE ðŸ˜‹ recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Start out with exchanging the bulbs. Accomplish this for the entire house, not merely the kitchen. You should upgrade your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. You also have to acquire the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not just the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
