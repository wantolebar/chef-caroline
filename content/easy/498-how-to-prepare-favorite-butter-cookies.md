<i>Before you jump to Butter cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen alone offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, after all. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
