recipeingredient:
- " skewers soaked ideally overnight but at least 6 hours or so"
- " boneless skinless chicken breast or thigh meat cut into roughly 13inch thick 15inch wide strips"
- " kosher salt"
- " coconut milk"
- " minced shallots"
- " packed brown sugar"
- " fish sauce"
- " oil"
- " zest of 1 lime"
- " fresh lime juice"
- " minced garlic about 2 large cloves"
- " curry powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken strips with the salt first and give them a good thorough mixing with your hands to ensure that the chicken is evenly seasoned with the salt. Let that sit for about 5 minutes while add the other ingredients into the bowl."
- "Combine the rest of the marinade ingredients with the salted chicken and again, using your hands, massage the ingredients gently and thoroughly into the chicken, making sure that all the components are evenly distributed throughout the chicken."
- "Cover the chicken and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 8. (What will happen if you marinate it longer? Well, it won&#39;t be terrible, but the longer proteins sit in a salty mixture, the more cured a texture they begin to take on. You can actually let this marinade go for 2 or 3 days before you cook the chicken, but I think up to 8 hours for chicken breast keeps optimal texture. Up to overnight for dark meat.)"
- "Skewer the chicken in roughly 6-inch segments. This may take combining 2 or more pieces together. No biggie. Also, if you&#39;re planning to cook the chicken over coals right after you skewer, right before Step 4 would be a good time to light your coals."
- "Grill the skewers over slightly lower than medium heat. 3 to 4.5 minutes per side for breast meat, 5.5 to 7 minutes per side for dark meat."
- "GRILLING TIPS: If you&#39;re grilling on a gas grill, you just need to preheat your grill to a just under medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes prior to cooking. If you&#39;re grilling with coals, since you&#39;re dealing with smaller, thinner skewer cuts, you&#39;ll want to make sure to give your coals plenty of time for the flames to burn out and then a little time for the white heat to dissipate just a bit before you start cooking."
- "GRILLING TIPS (cont): You&#39;ll be able to tell when some of the coals have returned to something more like the original charcoal color. And then there&#39;s always the hand test (assuming an even spread of the coals) in which you hold your hand an inch or two above the grill grates and judge the temp by how long you can hold it there before you have to pull it away. For the slightly less than medium heat you want for these satay skewers, 4 to 5 seconds should do it."
- "Enjoy! :)"

<i>Before you jump to Coconut Curry Chicken Satay recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. When our work day is complete, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Run the stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get wholesome. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about losing weight. You need your body to be powerful too.
