Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, after all. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
