It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that difficult. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
