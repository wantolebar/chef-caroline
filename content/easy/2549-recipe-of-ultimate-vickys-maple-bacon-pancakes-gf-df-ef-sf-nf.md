Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
