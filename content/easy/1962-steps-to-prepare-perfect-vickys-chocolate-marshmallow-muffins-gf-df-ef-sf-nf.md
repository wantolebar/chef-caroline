<i>Before you jump to Vickys Chocolate Marshmallow Muffins, GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
