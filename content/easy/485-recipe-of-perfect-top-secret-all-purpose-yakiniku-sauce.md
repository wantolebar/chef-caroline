recipeingredient:
- " Soy sauce"
- " Sake"
- " Mirin"
- " Sugar"
- " Brown cane sugar powdered"
- " Pear or apple"
- " Garlic"
- " knobs Sliced ginger"
- " Umami seasoning optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the jar for storage. As this sauce will be stored for a long time, make sure to clean the jar and dry it well. There should be no moisture inside."
- "Remove the skin from the garlic and lightly crush to release the flavour. Slice the ginger into 3-4 mm slices."
- "Cut the 1/4 of the pear or apple in half, keeping the peel and core parts - you should have 2 wedges that are 1/8 of the size of the fruit. Put the garlic, ginger and fruit into the jar."
- "[Tip 1] If you plan to use the sauce straight away, you can grate the garlic and fruit. But this sauce is aged, so you don&#39;t have to grate them."
- "Mix the liquid ingredients and the sugar well. Adjust the amount of sugar to taste. I usually add 4 tablespoons of sugar. Even if the sugar doesn&#39;t dissolve completely, it&#39;s fine."
- "[Tip 2] Do not heat the sauce to dissolve the sugar, as it robs the soy sauce and sake of their flavour. You just need to mix the sauce for a while."
- "[Tip 3] You can use any sugar you like, but the sauce tastes richer if you mix some brown sugar or honey in with the white sugar."
- "Pour the liquid into the jar and loosely screw on the lid. Let it age at room temperature for 10 days to 2 weeks. Mix from the bottom from time to time."
- "[Tip 4] The sauce has to breathe as it matures, so don&#39;t close the lid too tightly. However, if you&#39;re going to mix the sauce by shaking the bottle, make sure to screw it tight."
- "Once the aging process has finished, close the lid tightly and store it in the fridge. You can keep the garlic, ginger and fruits in it, but if you want the sauce to be clean, strain it."
- "[Tip 5] When the sauce turns clear and glossy, it&#39;s done."
- "There may be some garlic sediment in the sauce. When I made this in my restaurant, I used four times the ingredients and added the garlic whole, but in this recipe it&#39;s crushed."
- "If you prefer to make an authentic clear sauce, make this with 4 times the amount of ingredients. With that much, there&#39;s no need to crush the garlic or slice the ginger! If you like this method, make a lot, as it can keep for a long time."
- "[Tip 6] You can use the garlic and ginger for another dish. Just chop them up and stir-fry -- it&#39;ll be delicious. However, don&#39;t reuse the fruit."
- "[Tip 7] The more aged the sauce is, the more delicious it is. The best way to preserve the taste is to keep mixing in new sauce."
- "[Adding new sauce] Strain the sauce that you have on hand first, then add the old and new sauces to a new jar. If more than 1/5 of your sauce is properly aged, you can add it to a dish right away."

<i>Before you jump to Top Secret All-Purpose Yakiniku Sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle demands. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some hints to be as healthful as possible.

Make smart decisions when grocery shopping. When you make good decisions at the grocery store, your meals will get healthier automatically. Think for a minute: you don't want to go to a busy grocery store or sit in a lengthy line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to get home immediately and have something great. Your home should be stocked with healthy foods and ingredients. By doing this, even when you choose that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are a lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. You need to help make your body as strong as possible.
