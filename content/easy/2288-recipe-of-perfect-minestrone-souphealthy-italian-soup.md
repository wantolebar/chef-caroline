<i>Before you jump to Minestrone soup(Healthy Italian soup) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as economically as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
