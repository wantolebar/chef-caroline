<i>Before you jump to LG&#39;s CHICKEN DUMPLING SOUP recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as effectively as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
