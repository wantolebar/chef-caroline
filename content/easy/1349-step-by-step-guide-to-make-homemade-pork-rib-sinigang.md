recipeingredient:
- "1 large onion thinly sliced"
- "1 full rack pork back ribs trimmed and cut into 2 rib segments"
- "6 cloves garlic roughly chopped"
- "6 cups vegetable stock"
- "4 large bay leaves"
- "1/2 cup tamarind concentrate"
- "3 tbsp fish sauce"
- "3 Roma tomatoes chopped"
- "1 jalapeno halved"
- "1 large eggplant chopped into 2 cm chunks"
- "1 large handful green beans trimmed"
- "8 pcs baby bok choy"
- "2 cups baby spinach"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add a splash of veg oil to a wide, high-sided pan on medium-high heat. Add the onions and fry for 2 to 3 minutes until softened. Season the ribs with salt and pepper and add them to the pan. Sear about 2 minutes, then flip and sear about 2 minutes more. At the flip, add the garlic. As the ribs brown, move the onions and garlic around a bit so they don&#39;t burn."
- "Add enough stock to the pan to cover the ribs. If more liquid is needed, just top up with water. Add the bay leaves, tamarind concentrate, and fish sauce. Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down to medium-low. After 15 minutes, skim any foam from the surface."
- "Add the tomatoes and jalapeno to the pan. Cover, and let simmer for 1 1/2 hrs until the meat is tender. Add water as needed to keep the ribs submerged."
- "Remove the bay leaves and jalapeno. Add the eggplant and turn the heat back up to medium-high. Continue simmering uncovered for 5 minutes. Add the beans and bok choy and simmer another 5 minutes. Check the seasoning and add salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste. Take the pan off the heat and add the spinach. Give the spinach a minute to wilt, then serve the soup hot with steamed rice."

<i>Before you jump to Pork rib sinigang recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Climb stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are a whole lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. Little things, when done each day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about losing weight. It’s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
