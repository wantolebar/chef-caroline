<i>Before you jump to Easy chocolate mug cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Let us begin with something quite simple, changing the particular light bulbs. Do this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in different rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and discover just how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply utilizing common sense.
