- "Using a wooden spoon, stir in 1 3/4 cup of the cilantro, reserving about 1/2 cup for serving."
- "Serve in bowls topped with the feta cheese (if you wish) and fresh cilantro. **Important safety tip** Let the batch of chili cool down to lukewarm - up to 90 minutes after cooking - before putting it in the refridgerator. This will keep the inside of your fridge at the proper temperature for safe food storage."

<i>Before you jump to Turkey Veggie Chili recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Select water over other drinks. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every now and then isn’t a horrible idea. It will be, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. Ingesting water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to aid your body in its health and hydration. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories from your diet— without having to resort to terrible tasting diet food. Water is often the main element to successful weight loss and healthfulness.

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also important. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. You need to help make your body as strong it can be.
