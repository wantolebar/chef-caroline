recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Long pasta 14 to 16 mm thick is best"
- "45 ml A Extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 to 2 small cloves A Garlic sliced thinly or fnely chopped"
- "1 Red chili peppers sliced into rounds"
- "10 ml B Garlic oilor substitute with extra virgin olive oil"
- "40 ml B Water"
- "1 bit less than 12 teaspoon B Cake flour"
- "1 Black pepper whole or coarsely ground"
- "3 liter C Water"
- "35 ml 2 tablespoons  C Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring the C. water (the pasta water) to a boil in a large pot. Just before the water comes to a boil, add the C. salt, measuring it out properly."
- "Normally you would use 1% salt water (1 tablespoon of salt to 1.5 liters of water), but this time a little more salt is added."
- "Adding a generous amount of salt to the pasta water, makes it easier for everyone to easily produce great tasting pasta (Tip 1)."
- "Combine the B. ingredients and mix until there are no more flour lumps (Tip no. 2 / See Step 12 for details)."
- "Put the A. ingredients in a cold frying pan. Cook over low heat to slowly transfer the flavor and fragrance of the garlic to the oil (Tip 3.)."
- "When the garlic oil in Step 5 is getting bubbly and fragrant, add the red chili pepper before the garlic starts to change color."
- "If you are using bacon, add it when you are cooking the garlic. For crispy bacon, add it at the beginning; for softer bacon add it midway through onwards."
- "While the garlic and oil (and optional bacon) are cooking, cook the pasta in the water you heated in Step 1, for 30 seconds to a minute less than indicated on the package. Cook over low heat."
- "If you cook the pasta in rapidly boiling water, the water will evaporate and become saltier, and your pasta will get salty too. So cook the pasta over low heat (Tip 4)."
- "Note: Make sure the pasta water doesn&#39;t come to a rolling boil before or after adding the pasta."
- "When the garlic in the frying pan from Step 6 turns a light beige color, turn off the heat. Make sure not to burn the garlic."
- "Just before the pasta is cooked, put the Step 4 flour-water mixture into the Step 11 frying pan. Turn the heat up to medium, and swirl the pan around for about 15 seconds."
- "Important: As soon as the mixture in the frying pan becomes thick (which means it has emulsified), turn off the heat."
- "When you are making an oil-based pasta dish, the emulsification is very important. In restaurants this is provided via the pasta cooking water, which is thick because so much pasta is cooked in it. But in a home environment you only cook a little pasta at a time so the water doesn&#39;t get thick."
- "By adding cake flour to the oil, it gets emulsified much easier. It&#39;s a small detail, but to achive a restaurant-like result it&#39;s important."
- "Normally you can just add cake flour to some of the pasta water, but in this recipe the pasta water is higher in salt than usual, so plain water and flour are mixed to maintain just the right degree of saltiness."
- "When the pasta is cooked, set the frying pan from Step 12 back over low-medium heat, and add the drained pasta."
- "Mix quickly so that the pasta is evenly coated with the oil."
- "Transfer to a serving plate, grind on some black pepper, and enjoy I think the seasoning should be just right without any adjustments needed at the end."

<i>Before you jump to Authentic Aglio, Olio, e Peperoncino recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These kinds of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Making use of these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not that tough. It's concerning being sensible, more often than not.
