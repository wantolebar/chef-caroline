recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set it aside."

<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Let us begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. This will go outside of the kitchen, but that is okay. You should change your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Using these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly come across members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
