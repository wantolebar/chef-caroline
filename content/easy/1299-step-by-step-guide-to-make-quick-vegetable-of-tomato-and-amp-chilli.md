<i>Before you jump to Vegetable of tomato &amp; chilli recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that tough. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
