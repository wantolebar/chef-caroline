recipeingredient:
- "3 Cups Mashed Potatoes Roughly"
- "1/3 Cup Smoked Salmon"
- "1/4 Cup Scallops"
- "5 Jumbo Shrimp"
- "1 Cup Cheddar Cheese"
- "2 Eggs"
- " Flour"
- " Bread Crumbs"
- " Old Bay Seasoning"
recipeinstructions:
- "Clean shrimp, slice in half lengthwise then chop into thirds. Slice scallops in half then quarter. Give the smoked salmon a good chopping. Prepare a breading station consisting of two eggs, bread crumbs and flour. You can add flour and bread crumbs as you need it. Add seafood to mashed potatoes. Give it some Old Bay. Add in the cheese. Combine. Your mashed potatoes are hopefully seasoned, so you won’t have to worry about seasoning them a second time."
- "Using the same method I use for shaping hamburgers (An open ended can on both sides) form the croquettes. These aren’t the traditional shape, but... it’s an improvement in my eyes. After they are formed, carefully dredge in flour, egg and finally bread crumbs while making sure to shake of excess after each stage of the process. Place on a baking sheet, cover with plastic and freeze for about an hour."
- "Place croquettes in hot oil. Should be enough to cover them. Be careful of the splatter... it’s a good investment at the dollar store to get one of these screens. I kept the flame on medium. The mashed potatoes are already cooked, but you want to give the shrimp and scallops time to cook as well as the cheese to melt. If the heat is too high, the breadcrumbs can burn and it’ll be undone in the center."
- "Allow to drain on a wire rack. These are great by themselves but I had it with a little sweet chili sauce."

<i>Before you jump to Seafood Croquettes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is done, most people do not wish to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a chore. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Be wise when you do your food shopping. Making good decisions when obtaining groceries means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. At the end of your day do you really want to deal with jampacked grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to go home and make something from your kitchen. Your home should be stocked with healthy foods and ingredients. In this way, even when you decide that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are a good deal of things that contribute to your getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also critical. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your health levels. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.

##### The ingredients needed to prepare Seafood Croquettes:

1. Prepare 3 Cups Mashed Potatoes (Roughly)
1. Take 1/3 Cup Smoked Salmon
1. Provide 1/4 Cup Scallops
1. Prepare 5 Jumbo Shrimp
1. Take 1 Cup Cheddar Cheese
1. Prepare 2 Eggs
1. Get  Flour
1. Provide  Bread Crumbs

##### Instructions to make Seafood Croquettes:

1. Clean shrimp, slice in half lengthwise then chop into thirds. Slice scallops in half then quarter. Give the smoked salmon a good chopping. Prepare a breading station consisting of two eggs, bread crumbs and flour. You can add flour and bread crumbs as you need it. Add seafood to mashed potatoes. Give it some Old Bay. Add in the cheese. Combine. Your mashed potatoes are hopefully seasoned, so you won’t have to worry about seasoning them a second time.
1. Using the same method I use for shaping hamburgers (An open ended can on both sides) form the croquettes. These aren’t the traditional shape, but... it’s an improvement in my eyes. After they are formed, carefully dredge in flour, egg and finally bread crumbs while making sure to shake of excess after each stage of the process. Place on a baking sheet, cover with plastic and freeze for about an hour.
1. Place croquettes in hot oil. Should be enough to cover them. Be careful of the splatter... it’s a good investment at the dollar store to get one of these screens. I kept the flame on medium. The mashed potatoes are already cooked, but you want to give the shrimp and scallops time to cook as well as the cheese to melt. If the heat is too high, the breadcrumbs can burn and it’ll be undone in the center.
1. Allow to drain on a wire rack. These are great by themselves but I had it with a little sweet chili sauce.
