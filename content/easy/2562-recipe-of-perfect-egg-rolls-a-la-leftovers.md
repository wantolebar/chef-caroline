Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Probably the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
