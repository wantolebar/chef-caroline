Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.
