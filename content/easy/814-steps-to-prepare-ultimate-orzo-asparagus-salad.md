<i>Before you jump to Orzo Asparagus Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Start with changing the lights. Complete this for the whole house, not merely the kitchen. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent type, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently discover members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. This also happens in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
