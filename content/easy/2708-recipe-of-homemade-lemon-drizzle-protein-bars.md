<i>Before you jump to Lemon Drizzle Protein Bars recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is complete, most people do not wish to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. Trying to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about losing weight. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
