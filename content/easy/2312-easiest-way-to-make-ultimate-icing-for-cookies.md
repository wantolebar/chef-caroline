- "If it&#39;s too soft, adjust by adding sugar gradually until it reaches a firmness, which is easy to use."
- "For the cookies, it&#39;s best to use soft icing (the kind that drizzles slowly if you scoop it up). For drawing borders or letters, harder icing is best."
- "For fine details, I make a cone-shaped piping bag. Take an A4 sized sheet of plastic, cut it into a square, and then into a triangle. The yellow arrow indicates the middle."
- "Roll up the sheet from the corner. Take care that there are no gaps in the yellow arrow."
- "Once you&#39;re finished rolling, check the pointed tip one more time, then secure the cone with tape. Using lots of tape is best."

<i>Before you jump to Icing for Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Be smart when you do your food shopping. Making good decisions when shopping for groceries means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. At the end of your day do you really want to deal with crowded grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You’re going to go home and use what you already have. Your kitchen should be stocked with healthy foods and ingredients. This makes it effortless to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is naturally better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get wholesome. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about losing weight. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
