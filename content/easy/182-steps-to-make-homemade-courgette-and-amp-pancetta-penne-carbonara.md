recipeingredient:
- "200 g penne pasta"
- "2 large freerange egg yolks"
- "50 ml single cream"
- "handful grated pecorino cheese"
- " olive oil"
- "2 small courgettes ideally fairly thin"
- "100 g pancetta cut into lardons"
- "1 garlic clove crushed and chopped optional"
- "a few thyme or basil leaves"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put a large pan of salted water on to boil."
- "If you have thick courgettes, you&#39;ll want to cut them down by either halving or even quartering them lengthways. Then slice them into pieces similarly sized to the penne."
- "Add the penne to the boiling water and cook according to packet instructions. I prefer to aim for al dente!"
- "To make the carbonara sauce...  Separate the egg yolks and put them in a bowl. Discard the whites. (I sometimes use the eggs whole, but yolk-only is the traditional way!)  Add the cream and grate in half the pecorino cheese. Mix together with a fork.   Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, and put to one side for later."
- "Heat a large frying pan and add a splash of olive oil. Fry the pancetta until dark brown and crisp. (I personally like to fry them with a bit of garlic, but this is very much not traditional!)"
- "Add the sliced courgette to the frying pan. And add a pinch or two of black pepper."
- "This is an important step to get right...  When the pasta is cooked, drain it, and reserve some of the cooking water. (I like to catch some of the water by putting the colander on top of a mug while I drain.)  While the pasta is still very hot (be quick!), toss the pasta in the pan with the courgettes and bacon. Then quickly remove from the heat, add a little bit of the reserve pasta water, and add the carbonara sauce. Stir together quickly. Keep it moving and do not let the eggs set/scramble."
- "While tossing the pasta, add a little more of the grated pecorino. (Retain the rest of the pecorino for serving on top of the pasta.) At this stage also consider adding some more of the reserve water if the pasta&#39;s not silky enough."
- "Serve the pasta into dishes. Add grated pecorino on top (as per your guest&#39;s preferences), cracked black pepper, and sprinkle your favourite green herbs on top (basil or thyme)."

<i>Before you jump to Courgette &amp; Pancetta Penne Carbonara recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Perhaps the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is not true. Mainly if you make certain the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
