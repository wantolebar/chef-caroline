- "Bring a large pot of water to boil and add 1 or 2 tsp salt to it. Next I&#39;ll introduce 2 ways to make spätzle - one with the cutting board and one with a wide hole colander/tray. (If you have a spätzle press you probably know how to use it...)"

- "Scoop the spätzle out into a bowl of cold water with a strainer in it. This will prevent them from turning into a big clump. Continue cooking the rest of the spätzle. When finished drain and use as desired! Some suggestions below."

- "They are great with creamy sauces, bacon and fish too. In this photo I put some chopped spinach in the batter and served with a creamy mushroom and crabs sauce."
- "Of course there&#39;s the classic Schwäbisch Linsen mit Spätzle too, where a thick lentil stew is served over top the spätzle. See recipe here: https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/269888"

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Spätzle / Knöpfle recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Climb stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the decisions you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about losing weight. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
