<i>Before you jump to Steph&#39;s Mushroom neptunes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.

Consider the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the decisions you make each day is a start. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. You need your body to be strong too.
