<i>Before you jump to 2 minutes Vanilla mug cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is done, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people choose the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every single day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't forget that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need your body to be powerful too.
