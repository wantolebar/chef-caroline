<i>Before you jump to Green Smoothie Tuesday recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, usually.
