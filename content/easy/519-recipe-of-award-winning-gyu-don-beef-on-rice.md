<i>Before you jump to Gyu Don (Beef on Rice) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. It's concerning being sensible, more often than not.
