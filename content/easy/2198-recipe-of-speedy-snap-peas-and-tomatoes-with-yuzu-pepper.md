Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's about being functional, most of the time.
