Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is not true. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.
