<i>Before you jump to Lemon Brisket recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty straightforward to live green, of course. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
