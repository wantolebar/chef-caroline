<i>Before you jump to Instant biscuit Modak recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
