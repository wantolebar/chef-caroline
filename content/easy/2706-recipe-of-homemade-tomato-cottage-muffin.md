<i>Before you jump to Tomato Cottage Muffin recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. It's about being practical, most of the time.
