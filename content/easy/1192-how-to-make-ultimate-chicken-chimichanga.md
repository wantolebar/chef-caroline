<i>Before you jump to Chicken Chimichanga recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Start out with changing the lights. Accomplish this for the whole house, not merely the kitchen. You should replace your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Together with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The kitchen lights especially are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and see just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
