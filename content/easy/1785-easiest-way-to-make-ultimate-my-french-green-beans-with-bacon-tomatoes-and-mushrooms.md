You need to replace your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills.
