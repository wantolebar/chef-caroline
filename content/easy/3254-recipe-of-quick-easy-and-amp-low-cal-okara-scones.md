<i>Before you jump to Easy &amp; Low-Cal Okara Scones recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
