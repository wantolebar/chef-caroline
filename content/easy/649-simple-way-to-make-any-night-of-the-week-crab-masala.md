<i>Before you jump to Crab masala recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.

Be wise when you do your food shopping. When you make good decisions at the grocery store, your meals will get much healthier immediately. Think for a minute: you don't want to go to a stressful grocery store or sit in a long line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to get home immediately and have something good. Fill your pantry shelves with wholesome foods. This way—even if you pick out something slightly greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still choosing foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get wholesome. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
