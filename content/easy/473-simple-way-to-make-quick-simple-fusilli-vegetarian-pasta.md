<i>Before you jump to Simple Fusilli vegetarian pasta recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
