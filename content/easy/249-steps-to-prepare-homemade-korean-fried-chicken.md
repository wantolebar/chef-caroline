- "In a pan, add all the sauce ingredients, and stir well. Bring it to a boil. When it starts to bubble, reduce the heat to medium low, and simmer until it thickens slightly, about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the heat off."

- "Pour about 1 inch of oil in to a heavy bottom pan. When the oil is sufficiently hot (350°F or starts smoking), drop the chicken pieces in one at a time. Fry them in two batches. Overcrowding will drop the oil temperature too quickly. Cook until light golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and set them on a wire rack or a paper towel-lined plate."

<i>Before you jump to Korean Fried Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

You may possibly prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, nonetheless that is certainly not true. Particularly if you make certain the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty straightforward to live green, of course. It's related to being sensible, most of the time.
