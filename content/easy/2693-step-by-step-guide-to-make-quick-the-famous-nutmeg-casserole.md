<i>Before you jump to The Famous Nutmeg Casserole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some hints to be as healthful as possible.

Go up the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the decisions you make each day is a start. Trying to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. You want your body to be powerful too.
