<i>Before you jump to Sweet potato and peanut soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as effectively as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being functional, more often than not.
