<i>Before you jump to Veggie pulao with biryani twist recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of electrical power is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that difficult. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
