recipeingredient:
- "2 Eggs"
- "30 grams Unsalted butter"
- "1 Chocolate bar"
- "60 grams Granulated sugar"
- "100 grams Flour"
- "20 grams Pure cocoa"
- "1 tsp Baking powder can be omitted"
- "100 ml Milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Separate the egg whites and yolks and add to separate bowls. Melt the butter and set side. Combine and sift the ☆ ingredients. Break up the chocolate in the wrapper. Preheat the oven to 170℃."
- "First, whip up the meringue. Add about half of the granulated sugar to the egg whites and use a whisk to whip until soft peaks form."
- "For the next step, don&#39;t wash the whisk, use as-is. Whip the egg yolks and remaining granulated sugar. Whip to a moderate heaviness. Then, add the melted butter and lightly mix with a rubber spatula."
- "Add a fourth of the meringue to the mixture in Step 3 and use the rubber spatula to mix the dough lightly (it&#39;s fine if the meringue is crushed). Sift the ☆ ingredients again and add in two batches. Then add milk and continue to mix."
- "Add the crushed chocolate and remaining meringue in two batches, and mix together. Once everything has been mixed together, pour into the cups, set on a baking pan, rap it against a surface to remove air bubbles and put into the oven."
- "Bake for about 20 to 25 minutes. It&#39;s done once a bamboo skewer pushed through comes out clean. Let cool. I used a pudding mold with baking paper, but you could also make these in a muffin pan."
- "If you eat these while they&#39;re still warm, the chocolate is creamy (the photo is 2 hours after baking. They were still melty). Leave for a day and the chocolate will stiffen and become dense. I like leaving it for a day."
- "I made a version adding 3 g of black cocoa. It resulted in slightly bitter muffins--great for the mature palate."

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
