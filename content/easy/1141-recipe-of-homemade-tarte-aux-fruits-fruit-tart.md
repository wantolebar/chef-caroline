- " Powdered sugar or sugar"
- " Egg yolk or whole egg"
- " few drops Vanilla oil"

- " Almond cream"
- " Butter"
- " Sugar"
- " Egg"

- " Jam of your choice"
- " as much to taste Fruit"
- " Nappage"
recipeinstructions:
- "For the tart dough: Leave the butter come to room temperature (or microwave for a few seconds) and mash with a spatula to soften. Mix with a whisk until creamy and glossy."
- "Add the powdered sugar to the butter in a few batches, cream with the whisk until white and fluffy."
- "Add the egg yolks and vanilla oil and mix well. With a spatula, incorporate the flour using cutting motions. When the dough comes together, wrap it in plastic and leave to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour (If possible, rest the dough overnight. This will prevent the tart shrinking while it bakes)."
- "Remove the dough from the freezer, sandwich between two sheets of cling film, and roll out to a thickness of 2 mm. Grease a tart tray with softened butter (or oil) and dust it with bread flour. Press the dough into the edges of the pan, and prick holes in the base with a fork. Place in the fridge."
- "Make the almond cream: you make it just as you did the tart crust, but with different ingredients. Also, use a whisk to mix rather than a spatula. (Powdered sugar, sugar/yolk, egg/cake flour, almond flour.)"
- "Pour the Step 5 mixture into the Step 4 crust. If you do this with a piping bag, the tart will look great when finished (you can use a spoon instead). Smooth out the surface leaving a small depression in the centre."
- "Bake in a 170째C to 180 째C oven for about 35 minutes. (If it looks like it is getting burned, cover with a piece of foil.) When it&#39;s finished baking, cool on a cake rack."
- "When the tart is cool, take the mold off and spread the surface with jam. Cut up and pat dry the fruit, and use it to top the tart. Glaze with nappage, and if you have mint leaves place some on top."

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
