recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Pancake mix for plain buns"
- "170 ml Milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the milk to the pancake mix and mix. As long and the flour and milk blend together it&#39;s fine. Don&#39;t overmix."
- "Pour the batter into the aluminium foil cups about 70% full. Pour 5 mm - 1 cm of water in a frying pan, and arrange the foil cups in the pan."
- "Cover with a lid, and start heating the frying pan on high heat. When the water comes to a boil, turn the heat down to low and steam for 10 to 12 minutes."
- "Done. Be careful not to let the condensation fall on the bread when you remove the lid off."
- "This is a cocoa version. I added 1-2 tablespoon of cocoa powder, 1 tablespoon sugar and a little vegetable oil (optional) to the basic batter, and steamed the same way."
- "The bread looks like this when it&#39;s cut open. So fluffy and light! Add 1 tablespoon condensed milk and 1 tablespoon skim milk powder, and use 160 ml of water instead of milk."
- "The cocoa version above is topped with chocolate chips, and made in mini muffin cups. Chocolate and cocoa do go well together."
- "We&#39;ve really been in to raisin steamed bread recently in our family. Just mix some raisins into the basic batter. This time the raisins sunk to the bottom."
- "When I divided the dough into 7, water often got into the cups while cooking, so I tried making 8 instead and this worked a lot better. So I recommend making 8 at a time."

<i>Before you jump to Pancake Mix Easy Steamed Buns recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even just a individual flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You need to help to make your body as strong it can be.
