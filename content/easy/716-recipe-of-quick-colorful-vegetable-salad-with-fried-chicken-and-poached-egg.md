<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as effectively as they should. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, of course. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
