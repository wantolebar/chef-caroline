Return the meatballs to the pan. Cover and turn the heat down to medium-low. Simmer for 5 minutes, remembering to gently turn the meatballs over every so often. Check the seasoning and add extra salt and pepper to taste."
- "While the sauce continues simmering, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. When the noodles are almost cooked, add the basil and parsley to the sauce. Toss the noodles with the sauce and top with plenty of freshly grated parmesan cheese when serving."

<i>Before you jump to Spaghetti and Meatballs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is complete, most people do not wish to go to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Make smart decisions when grocery shopping. If you make smart choices when you are purchasing your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think for a second: you don't want to go to a stressful grocery store or sit in a lengthy line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to go home and make something from your kitchen. Make sure that what you already have is nutritious. By doing this, even when you decide that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need to make your body as strong as possible.
