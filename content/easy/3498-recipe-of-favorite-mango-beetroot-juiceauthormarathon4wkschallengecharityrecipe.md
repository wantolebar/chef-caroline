<i>Before you jump to Mango-Beetroot Juice#authormarathon#4wkschallenge#charityrecipe# recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Run the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the selections you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. You really want your body to be powerful too.
