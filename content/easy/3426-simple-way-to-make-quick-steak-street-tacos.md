<i>Before you jump to Steak Street Tacos recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that difficult. It's about being sensible, usually.
