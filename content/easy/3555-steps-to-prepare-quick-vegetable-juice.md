recipeingredient:
- "5-6 leaves spinach"
- "10 mint leaves"
- "7 tulsi leaves"
- "10 curry leaves"
- "Few carrot leaves if available"
- "1-2 cucumber peeled and diced or sliced 1 cup diced bottlegourd"

- "1 apple peeled and diced"
- "2 inches ginger peeled"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and prepare all the ingredients. Put a glass under the outlet of the juice extractor to catch the juice. Start the machine and add fruits and veggies one at a time, pushing them downwards with a stick. Start with leaves followed by soft vegetables and fruits such as apple and cucumber. Add a few dices/sticks of solid vegetables like a carrot in between. This helps to extract juice from soft veggies. Keep some carrot dices for the end so all the juice remaining in the machine comes out."
- "Sieve it and consume right away."
- "Notes: juice extractor Vs a blender: 1. Juice extractor extracts juice by squeezing the veggies and fruits. No heat is produced during the process. So it maintains the enzymes. 2. No need to add water, so you get pure juice. WHEREAS a blender makes juice by breaking them down to the tiniest pieces, most of which gets sieved and what you retrieve is a glass of coloured and flavoured water that you added to be able to blend. Most enzymes and antioxidants evaporate due to the heat produced."
- "You can change the quantity of the vegetables or totally skip as per your taste and availability. What is a must are - apple, carrots and cucumber /bottle gourd Apple adds sweetness, carrot adds much juice and cucumber/gourd helps to dilute the juice."
- "Caution: Ensure that the vegetables are washed really well removing the bacteria as well as the chemicals. You may soak them in soda-bi-carb water (warm) for 10 -15 min before use OR use organic vegetables and fruits."
