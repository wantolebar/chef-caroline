- "2 large heads broccoli rinsed and thoroughly dried Shake off excess water"
- "1 Tablespoon olive oil"
- " optional 1 teaspoon onion powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 435 F / 225 C then cut up your broccoli, stems and all. I usually trim the bottom 1/8&#34; from the stem, cut it into florets, dividing the florets into 2 or 3 even pieces, depending on their size.   Then cut the stems into 1/4&#34; thick coins.  Put it all in a large mixing bowl."
- "Toss thoroughly with olive oil and (optional) onion powder."
- "Spread over two baking sheets/sheet pans. You don&#39;t want to crowd the broccoli because then you won&#39;t get a good roast with the crispy bits.  Put in the oven and roast for 20 minutes.  If you want to serve with aioli (link above), you can make that now while the broccoli&#39;s roasting."
- "After 20 minutes, take out of the oven, let cool for about 5 minutes, transfer to a serving dish, and watch them disappear!"

<i>Before you jump to Roasted Broccoli (Family Fave Snack - Don’t knock it ‘til you try it!) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Go up the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
