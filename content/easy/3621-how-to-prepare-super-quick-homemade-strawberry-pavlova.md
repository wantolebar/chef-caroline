<i>Before you jump to Strawberry pavlova recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Start out with replacing the lights. Do this for the entire house, not merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to obtain the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The kitchen lights especially are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, after all. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
