<i>Before you jump to Indian Masala Chai recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as economically as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
