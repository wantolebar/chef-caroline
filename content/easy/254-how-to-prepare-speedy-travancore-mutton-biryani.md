<i>Before you jump to Travancore Mutton Biryani recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Let us begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. This will probably go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. You need to upgrade your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. You also have to obtain the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The family spends major time in the kitchen area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, of course. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
