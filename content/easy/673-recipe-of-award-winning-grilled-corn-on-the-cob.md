<i>Before you jump to Grilled corn on the cob recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as efficiently as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, after all. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
