- "Add a couple drops of vanilla and knead well."
- "Arrange the caramelized apples into the pan from Step 6 into a single layer. Don&#39;t add any remaining juice or caramel."
- "Pour the batter into the pan and smooth the top. Drop from a few centimeters up 2~3 times to remove any air bubbles from the batter."
- "Bake for about 35 minutes. If the surface is nicely browned and a toothpick or skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, it&#39;s ready."
- "When it has cooled, flip the cake out of the pan and onto a plate. Wrap with plastic and let cool."
- "It&#39;s good while still warm, but it tastes even better if you let it sit in the refrigerator overnight."
