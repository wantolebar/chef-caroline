<i>Before you jump to Vegan Banana Nut Chocolate Chip Muffins recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Start with replacing the bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent type, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Utilizing these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Together with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This also occurs in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that difficult. Mostly, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
