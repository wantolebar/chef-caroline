Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
