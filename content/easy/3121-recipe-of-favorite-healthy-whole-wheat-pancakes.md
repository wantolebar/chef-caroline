Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. It's related to being sensible, most of the time.
