recipeingredient:
- "2 tbsp. unsalted butter melted and slightly cooled"
- "4 large eggs"
- "3/4 cup milk"
- "3/4 cup all purpose flour"
- "1 tbsp. granulated sugar"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1/4 tsp. salt"
- "2 tbsp. additional unsalted butter for the muffin tins"
- " nonstick spray see note in step 4"
- " confectioners sugar for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the first 2 tbsp. butter, eggs, milk, flour, sugar, vanilla and salt in a blender and mix well, until smooth and frothy."
- "Leave the batter in the blender and let it rest for at least 20 minutes. This gives the flour time to absorb the liquid. The texture and taste will be even better after it is given time to rest (or so I&#39;ve read)."
- "Place a 12 cup standard sized muffin tin (or 2 of the 6 cup muffin tins) into the oven. Preheat the oven to 425°F, with the muffin tins in the oven while it heats."
- "Once the oven is pre-heated, melt the additional 2 tbsp. of butter. Carefully remove the hot muffin tins from the oven (at this point I would recommend spraying the muffin tins with non-stick spray. I didn&#39;t the first time I tried this recipe and my Dutch babies stuck badly to the pan, even with the butter). Quickly brush the bottoms and sides of each cup with the melted butter, using a pastry brush."
- "Pour the batter into the hot, buttered muffin tins, filling to the halfway point."
- "Place muffin tins back in the oven and bake 7 minutes. Rotate the pan and bake an additional 7 minutes or until golden in color and puffy. Remove from oven. The pancakes will quickly deflate in the centers."
- "Dust with the confectioners sugar and then serve immediately, either as is or with preferred toppings."

<i>Before you jump to Mini Dutch Baby Pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even just a individual flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also critical. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your healthfulness. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
