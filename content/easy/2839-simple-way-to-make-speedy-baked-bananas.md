- "6 ripe bananas"
- " Juice of 1 lemon"
- "6 tablespoons honey"
- "6   teaspoons of ground cinnamon"
- "1 vanilla pod split along its length with each half then cut into thirds to give six equally sized pieces"
- "12 tablespoons dark rum"
- "6 squares of tinfoil about 40  40 cm"
recipeinstructions:
- "Fold the tinfoil sheets in half, then tightly fold in each side to make a rectangular parcel that’s open along the top. Ensure that the parcels are long enough to hold a banana."
- "Peel the bananas and rub them with lemon juice to prevent them from going brown."
- "Put one peeled banana into each foil parcel and add 2 tablespoons of rum, 1 tablespoon of honey, ¼ teaspoon of ground cinnamon and one of the six pieces of vanilla pod."

- "Remove the parcels from the barbecue using tongs and / or gloves, again taking care not to pierce the foil."

<i>Before you jump to Baked Bananas recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Make smart decisions when shopping for groceries. If you make smart decisions when you are purchasing your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to cope with a chaotic store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You want to get home immediately and eat something great. Your kitchen should be stocked with healthy foods and ingredients. This way—even if you decide on something a little greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still choosing foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You want your body to be powerful too.
