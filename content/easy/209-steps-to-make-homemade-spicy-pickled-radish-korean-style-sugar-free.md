- " radish peeled and sliced"
- " or more white vinegar"
- " Stevia or to taste"
- " Gochujang Korean chilli paste"
- " fine salt"
- " Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "I soaked my radish in the fridge in water before I made the recipe. Threw away the water before I added the vinegar. So no need to dilute your vinegar unless you want to reduce tanginess. Add water according to your preference."
- "Combine all ingredients in a container. If you are using all of the radish, make sure the vinegar is enough to reach the radish on the top. Adjust according to sweetness or tanginess, recommended ratio is 1:1 if you are using real sugar (or less if you don&#39;t like it too sweet). I used Stevia packets, which is sweeter so I used less. To make it spicy, any Gochujang brand is okay. Don&#39;t forget to add salt."
- "Refrigerate overnight and enjoy it the following day. :)"

<i>Before you jump to Spicy Pickled Radish (Korean style, sugar free) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is definitely not true. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
