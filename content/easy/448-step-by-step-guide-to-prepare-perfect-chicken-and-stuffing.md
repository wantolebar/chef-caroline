<i>Before you jump to Chicken and stuffing recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Mostly, all it will take is a little common sense.
