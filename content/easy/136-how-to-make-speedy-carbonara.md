<i>Before you jump to Carbonara recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as economically as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's about being practical, usually.
