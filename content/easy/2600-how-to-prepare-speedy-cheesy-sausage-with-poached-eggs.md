<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
