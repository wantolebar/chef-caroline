recipeingredient:
- "4 large Beef Short Ribs"
- " Olive Oil for frying"
- "1 large head of garlic cut in half horizontally"
- "1 tbsp Tomato Puree"
- "750 ml Bottle of good red wine"
- "1 liter Beef Stock"
- "150 grams pancetta cubed"
- "250 grams Chestnut mushrooms cleaned and quartered"
- " salt and pepper"
- " roughly chopped flat leaf parsley"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat your oven to 170° celcius....... you want to cook these ribs low, and slow!"
- "If your short ribs are still connected, you will need to seperate them, and then generously season them with salt and pepper. Then put a deep sided roasting tray with a good glug of olive oil on top of your hob, and whack it on full power!"
- "When your oil is screaming hot, add your short ribs to the roasting tray and brown then on all sides. Meanwhile, cut your garlic head in half horizontally, and then add to the roasting tray along with the tomato puree.  You will need to cook the puree for around 1 minute, otherwise it will be bitter."
- "Pour in the red wine to deglaze the tray, scraping up all of that beefy goodness! Bring to the boil, and cook for around 10-15 minutes until the wine has reduced by half."
- "Add the beef stock, to make the liquid level cover the ribs about half way up. Bring to the boil again, and then spoon the liquid over the ribs."
- "Cover the roasting tray with tin foil, and cook in the oven for 2½ hours.  You will need to baste the ribs every 30 minutes to make sure they absorb all of that winey flavour!"
- "Around 10 minutes before the rib are done, fry the pancetta in a tiny bit of olive oil for a couple of minutes until it is starting to crisp up, and then add your quartered chestnut mushrooms cooking for 5 minutes."
- "Now it is time to take your short ribs out of the oven..... take them out of the roasting tray, set them aside and prepare your amazing sauce!"
- "You need to remove each garlic clove from the roasting tray and pass them through a fine sieve into a bowl, and then remove any excess fat from the surface of the red wine juices in the tray.  The best way to do this is to lay a few pieces of kitchen roll on the top, and it will absorb it all.  Then strain the juices through the same sieve that you used for the garlic into the same bowl.  If the sauce is too thin, pop it into a pan and reduce for around 10 minutes, until it reaches the right consistency."
- "Lay your short ribs onto a serving platter, and scatter the pancetta and mushrooms over the top.  The pour over the sauce, which should be the right thickness to coat the back of a spoon."
- "Roughly chop your flat leaf parsley, and sprinkle over the top!"

<i>Before you jump to Beef Short Ribs in Red Wine recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
