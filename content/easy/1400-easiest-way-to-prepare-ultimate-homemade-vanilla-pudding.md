recipeingredient:
- "2 cups whole milk"
- "1/2 cup heavy cream"
- "3 large egg yolks beaten"
- "1/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "3 tbsp. cornstarch"
- "1/8 tsp. salt"
- "1 tbsp. unsalted butter"
- "2 tsp. pure vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium bowl, whisk together the beaten egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch and salt....it will be pretty lumpy, but that&#39;s fine. Set it aside. Place the milk and cream into a large pot over medium heat. Let it heat to a simmer, stirring often, but do not let it come to a boil. Once it begins to simmer, remove it from the heat."
- "Slowly add in 1 cup of the heated milk into the egg yolk mixture while whisking constantly to temper the eggs. Once it&#39;s all whisked together, whisk the egg mixture back into the pot of heated milk and return it to the burner. Now, cook this mixture over medium heat for 8-10 minutes, stirring nearly constantly, until it is nice and thick."
- "Once thickened, remove the pot from the heat and immediately stir in the butter. Once it&#39;s melted in, stir in the vanilla extract. Now run the pudding through a fine mesh sieve with a rubber spatula to remove any lumps and to get the smoothest pudding."
- "At this point, either keep it in the bowl you strained it into or separate it into individual serving cups. Either way, you&#39;re going to cover the pudding with plastic wrap. You want to press the plastic wrap lightly onto the surface of the pudding, to prevent a skin from forming."
- "Let it chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours before serving. Then eat it plain or top with some yummy toppings (pictured here with chocolate curls and banana slices). It&#39;ll last up to 3 days in the fridge."

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Vanilla Pudding recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to work less frequently, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. Typically, all it requires is a little common sense.
