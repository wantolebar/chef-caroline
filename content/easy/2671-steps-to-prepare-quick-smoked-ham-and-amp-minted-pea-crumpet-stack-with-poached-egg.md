recipeingredient:
- "2 crumpets"
- "7 g salted butter for spreading"
- "Half a small can of mushy peas around 150g"
- " Thin cured and smoked German ham slices around 34"
- "1 medium fresh egg"
- "1 pinch dried mint"
- " Salt and pepper to season"
- " Dried parsley to garnish optional"
- " For poaching the egg"
- "1 good pinch of salt"
- "1 tbsp white wine vinegar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring a small saucepan of salted water to the boil and turn down the heat a notch so the bubbles are gently rolling inside the pan, so it&#39;s not too vigorous. Stir through the white wine vinegar."
- "Gently crack the egg into a small bowl, ensuring the yolk is still intact."
- "Place the crumpets in the toaster and begin to toast them to your preference. In a small saucepan or in the microwave heat the mushy peas until warm. Season with a little salt and pepper. Stir through a good pinch of dried mint."
- "Using an egg timer or clock, as soon as a new minute has just past gently slide the egg from the bowl into the boiling water, make sure this is done so the yolk isn&#39;t split. Time the egg for exactly two minutes. After two minutes, remove the egg using a slotted spoon and inspect it. If the egg white still looks a little translucent place it back for a few seconds. Place on some kitchen roll to remove any excess water."
