Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. It's about being functional, more often than not.
