- "150 grams Pork mince"

- "1/2 bunch Garlic chives"
- "1/2 Japanese leek"

- "1 tbsp Sake"
- "1 tbsp Oyster sauce"
- "1 Pepper"
- "20 largesized Gyoza dumpling skins"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add soy sauce and Chinese chicken stock powder (if you dissolve in hot water, use once it cools down) and mix well until the mixture becomes elastic. Cover with cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for about 1 to 2 hours."
- "Chop the Chinese cabbage roughly and rub with 1 teaspoon of salt. Squeeze the excess moisture gently. Chop the garlic chives and grate the ginger and garlic."

- "When the skins start to brown (if they don&#39;t look crispy, uncover and turn up the heat to high. Evaporate excess water in the pan), add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil from the side of the frying pan to crisp the skins. Cover and fry for 2 to 3 minutes."
- "This looks very crispy. I used a 20 cm frying pan. I also used sifted flour without lumps and dissolved 2 teaspoons of it in 50 ml water."

<i>Before you jump to Juicy &amp; Crispy Meat Gyoza Dumplings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good an area to begin with as any. This will go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. You need to change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly come across members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
