<i>Before you jump to Sweet pongal (sweet khichdi of South India) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Start with replacing the lights. Complete this for your house, not merely the kitchen. You need to change your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Making use of these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The kitchen lights especially tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Certainly this also happens in different rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
