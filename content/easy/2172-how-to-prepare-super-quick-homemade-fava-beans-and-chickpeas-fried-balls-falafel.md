<i>Before you jump to Fava beans and chickpeas fried balls - falafel recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as economically as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
