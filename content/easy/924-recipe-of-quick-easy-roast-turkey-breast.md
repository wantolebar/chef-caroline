<i>Before you jump to Easy Roast Turkey Breast recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that tough. It's related to being sensible, more often than not.
