recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Semolina flour"
- "50 grams Bread flour"
- "50 grams Cake flour"
- "2 small or medium Eggs"
- "2 tbsp Olive oil"
- "1 Cornstarch or katakuriko"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the dry ingredients together in a food processor and pulse twice to mix. Set the food processor to make bread."
- "Add the eggs and olive oil to Step 1 and mix until evenly blended."
- "It&#39;s okay if it&#39;s still a bit floury. Add everything into a plastic bag."
- "It will look a bit like udon noodles but, place a towel over the bag and step on the dough. Once it has spread out a bit, fold the dough into thirds, and step on it again."
- "Repeat about 5 to 6 times and it will be mixed well. Now let the dough rest for 1 hour. If it&#39;s summer, I think it&#39;s better to put it in the fridge."
- "Use the pasta machine to roll out the dough. First, divide the dough into thirds."
- "Roll out the dough at the thickest setting. By the way, 7 mm is the thickest setting with my pasta machine."
- "Take what you just made and fold it into thirds and roll it out to 7 mm. By doing this, the dough will be smoother."
- "After Step 8, roll it out to 6 mm and then 5 mm."
- "This time I&#39;m making pasta that&#39;s 1.5 mm so I rolled it 5 mm thick. (You can also make it as thin as 4 mm if you would like.) If you&#39;re going to make 6 mm fettuccine, flatten it to 2-3 mm."
- "Next, cut the pasta. This will take a bit of time and I recommend letting the dough dry a bit since it&#39;s easier to cut that way. Cover both sides with corn starch or katakuriko."
- "Once it&#39;s done cutting, dust with corn starch or katakuriko. Let it dry out a bit more."
- "Bring some water to a boil with a generous amount of salt, and boil the noodles. Once they float to the top, they&#39;re ready. Top with some sauce and dig in. This time I used the pasta for pasta con le melanzane - eggplant and tomato pasta."
- "Here I used it in a green pea and homemade bacon pasta, which is so spring-like!"

<i>Before you jump to Fresh Homemade Pasta Is The Best recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's concerning being functional, more often than not.
