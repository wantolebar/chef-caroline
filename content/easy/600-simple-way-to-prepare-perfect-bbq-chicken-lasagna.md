<i>Before you jump to BBQ Chicken Lasagna recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
