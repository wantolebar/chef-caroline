<i>Before you jump to Easy Bitter Melon and Potato Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
