<i>Before you jump to Easy avocado egg salad sandwich: kid approved! recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Run the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will decide to be lazy and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even just a individual flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done each day, can do a lot to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your health levels. You want your body to be powerful too.
