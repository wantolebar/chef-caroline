recipeingredient:
- "400 gms Cream cheese"
- "2 tbsp Lemon Juice"
- "1 tbsp Vanilla essence"
- "4 Eggs"
- "1 cup Caster Sugar"
- "30 Graham crackers or digestive biscuits powdered"
- "5-6 tbsp Butter"
- "2 cups Strawberries"
recipeinstructions:
- "Crush biscuits either in a food processor or with a rolling pin. Mix these crumbs and the butter well and make the base for the cheesecake. Press it down on the springform pan nicely. Bake this in a preheated oven on 180° for 15 mins until the crust bakes properly."
- "Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese and the sugar along with the vanilla essence until fluffy. This is an important step because beating it well makes your cheesecake really awesome. Cheese if not beaten well can make the cake lumpy. It will take good 12 mins."
- "Whisk the eggs well and add into the cream cheese mixture along with the lemon juice. Basically lemon is added to bring out the flavours."
- "Pour this cheese mix on the baked crust and pop it back into the oven for 40 to 50 mins or until the skewer inserted comes out clean. Let it cool down a bit before adding your favourite fruit toppings. Chill it in the refrigerator for a good 3 hours or better still overnight. Cover it up nicely in order to keep it fresh. Serve it the next day to enjoy it to the fullest."
- "Cheesecake is one of those really unique desserts that is made up of more than one layer. This dish is known for it&#39;s elegance and is served at many grand occasions as a main dessert. This version is a baked one by me. And though it is a baked one or not, it absolutely sets your heart aflutter. This regal dessert is one of it&#39;s kind and nothing can beat it. Be it a party or a get-together or a family reunion, be it any of the occasion, either simple or grand, this one surely rules the roost."

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows.

Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.
