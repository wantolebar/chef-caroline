<i>Before you jump to Sour Chilli potato &amp; sweet turmeric paneer (Veg) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many men and women wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that difficult. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
