You need to replace your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than just swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The family spends a lot of time in the cooking area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long.
