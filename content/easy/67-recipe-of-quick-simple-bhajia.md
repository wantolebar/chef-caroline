<i>Before you jump to Simple bhajia recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Start with exchanging the lights. Do this for the whole house, not merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them rather than incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Using these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to obtain the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. This also takes place in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
