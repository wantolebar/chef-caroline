recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the rice: Put the rice on to cook right away. 1/2 a cup of white rice will need 2 cups of water. Leave the cooker to rest. This should take 20-30 minutes, so it&#39;s best to get started with it while you prep the rest of the ingredients."
- "Holy Guacamole: Peel and chop two ripe avocado roughly into a bowl. Mash them into a chunky paste - this will take about 10 minutes. Add sugar to taste. Leave to rest on the side."
- "Chop your vegetables: Finely chop 1 large onion, 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 a large red pepper and 1/2 a large yellow pepper and leave them on the side. These will be cooked with the rice. Onions will be cooked with the beans."
- "Chop your garnish: De-seed and finely chop 1 large tomato. Shred green, leafy lettuce. These will be used to garnish the tortilla wrap. Leave these on the side."
- "Is your rice cooked: By this point, your rice should be cooked. Remove the rice from the cooker if it&#39;s an electric one. Wait for your cooker to cool if it&#39;s a pressure cooker."
- "Make Spicy Rice: Add 2 tbsp of olive oil to a shallow pan and let it heat. Add 2 tsp of Ginger Garlic Paste and cook in the oil. Add half the cup of finely chopped onions and garlic cloves and let these cook until golden. Add cooked rice and sautee, stirring frequently, for two minutes."
- "Spice up your rice: Add the yellow and red bell peppers and stir them into the rice. Add salt to taste, and liberal quantities of pepper and chilli flakes. Stir for another minute and a half. Remove from the pan and into a bowl. Leave to rest."
- "Refried Beans: Put 2 tbsp of olive oil in a pan. Sautee the remaining onions and garlic until golden. Take 1/2 a cup of baked beans (canned baked beans work fine) and add to the mix. Add salt and pepper to taste. Remove from the pan and into a bowl. Leave to rest."
- "Roasted Corn on the Cob: While your beans are frying, place two large sticks of corn on the cob over an open flame. Wait for the grains of corn to blacken and then turn the corn over with tongs. Your corn should be roasted in about 5 minutes. Rub sliced lemon over the corn to garnish."
- "Tortillas with Cheese: Heat two tortilla wraps in the microwave for about 30s each. Add liberal amounts of cheese spread or grated cheese in a line down the centre of the wrap."
- "Finishing touches: Add a line of refried beans over the cheese, and a line of spicy rice over the beans. Cover the rice with chopped tomatoes and shredded lettuce. Roll the tortilla by folding the bottom and the sides inward. Repeat with the second tortilla."
- "Plate Up!: Place the tortilla on a plate. Add some guacamole on the side, and the remaining spicy rice. Place the roasted corn on the cob on the side, and serve!"

<i>Before you jump to Tortillas with Refried Beans and Spicy Rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is done, most people do not wish to go to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Go up the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being clever when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also critical. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your lifestyle choices. It’s about making your body as strong as it can be.
