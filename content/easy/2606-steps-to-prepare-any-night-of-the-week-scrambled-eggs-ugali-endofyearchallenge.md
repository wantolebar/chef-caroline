<i>Before you jump to Scrambled Eggs/Ugali #Endofyearchallenge... recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good a spot to begin with as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you should use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more initially, these bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Making use of these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than simply exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
