Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is simply utilizing common sense.
