<i>Before you jump to Oreo discs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Let's begin with something quite simple, changing the actual light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen area. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. Along with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. This also occurs in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that tough. It's about being functional, more often than not.
