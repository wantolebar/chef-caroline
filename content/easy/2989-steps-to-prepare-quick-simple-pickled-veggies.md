Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago.
