<i>Before you jump to Smoked chicken caprese salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These kinds of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as economically as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less frequently, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
