<i>Before you jump to Vanilla mug cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less frequently, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
