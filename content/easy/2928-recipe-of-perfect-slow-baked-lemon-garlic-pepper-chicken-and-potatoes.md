<i>Before you jump to Slow Baked Lemon/Garlic Pepper Chicken and Potatoes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is done, most people do not wish to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

When you go to the grocery store, be smart about it. Making good decisions when shopping for groceries means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. Think for a second: you don't want to go to a stressful grocery store or sit in a long line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You’re going to go home and use what you have in the cupboards. Fill your pantry shelves with healthy foods. This way—even if you choose something a bit greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still choosing foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are lots of things you can pursue to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about losing weight. You really want your body to be strong too.
