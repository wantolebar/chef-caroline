<i>Before you jump to Yam egg rolls recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as effectively as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is simply utilizing common sense.
