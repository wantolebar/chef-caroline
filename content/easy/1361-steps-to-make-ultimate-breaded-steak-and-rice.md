<i>Before you jump to Breaded steak and rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Run the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an attempt on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about slimming down. You need your body to be powerful too.
