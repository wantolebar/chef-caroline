<i>Before you jump to Indian blackberry smoothie delight recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. It's related to being functional, more often than not.
