<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s Kids Extra Beefy Beef Stew recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A massive amount of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that difficult. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
