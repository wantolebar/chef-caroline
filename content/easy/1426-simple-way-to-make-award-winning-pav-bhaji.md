<i>Before you jump to Pav Bhaji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every single day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about slimming down. You need your body to be strong too.
