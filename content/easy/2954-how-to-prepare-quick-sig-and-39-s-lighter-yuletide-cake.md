<i>Before you jump to Sig&#39;s Lighter Yuletide Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is complete, most people do not wish to go to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Climb stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Trying to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. It’s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
