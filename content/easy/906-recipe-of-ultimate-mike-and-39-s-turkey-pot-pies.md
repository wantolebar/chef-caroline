- "Place your Grands Biscuits on top of mixture but don&#39;t pack them together too tightly. Your mixture will need some room to bubble up. There&#39;s also a chance this dish will simmer over so put some tinfoil underneath as a precaution."
- "Bake as per manufactures directions or, until biscuits have risen and browned."
- "Enjoy!"

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. It's related to being sensible, more often than not.
