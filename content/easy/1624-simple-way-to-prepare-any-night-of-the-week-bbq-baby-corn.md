<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
