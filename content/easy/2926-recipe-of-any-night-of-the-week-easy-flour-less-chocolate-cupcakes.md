<i>Before you jump to Easy Flour-less Chocolate Cupcakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that tough. It's related to being functional, more often than not.
