Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that difficult. Typically, all it requires is a little common sense.
