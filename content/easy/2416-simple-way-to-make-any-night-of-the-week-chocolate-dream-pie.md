recipeingredient:
- " MERINGUE PIE SHELL"
- "4 EGG WHITES room temperature"
- "1/2 tsp. cream of tartar"
- "1 cup superfine sugar"
- "1/8 tsp. salt"
- " FILLING"
- "4 egg yolks"
- "3 oz unsweetened chocolate"
- "1/2 cup superfine sugar"
- "1/8 tsp salt"
- "2 Tbsp water"
- "1 cup heavy cream whipped"
- " TOPPING"
- "1 cup heavy cream"
- "2 Tbsp superfine sugar"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla"
- "2 Tbsp grated unsweetened chocolate"
recipeinstructions:
- "PREHEAT oven to 250°F. Separate the eggs. BEAT the egg whites and cream of tartar in a bowl on high speed until foamy. While still beating constantly, ADD the sugar, 2 Tbsp. at a time, beating after each addition until sugar is dissolved before adding the next. (Rub a bit of meringue between thumb and forefinger; it should feel completely smooth.) Continue beating until whites are glossy and stand in stiff peaks."
- "SPREAD the meringue into a 9-inch Pyrex pie plate. With the back of a spoon, build up the edge to form a rim. The finished result should be in the shape of a pie shell."
- "BAKE the shell in 250°F oven until firm and wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Turn off the oven. Let the shell dry in oven, with door closed, until it is cool and crisp, at least 1 hour."
- "Melt chocolate in a microwave safe dish"
- "In a bowl, beat the egg yolks, the sugar, salt and water."
- "Using a mixer, slowly stir some of the melted hot chocolate into the egg yolk mixture. Constant mixing is required so that the hot chocolate doesn&#39;t curdle the egg yolks. Keep adding the chocolate, stirring constantly, until all the chocolate has been added to the egg yolks and the mixture is smooth."
- "Transfer the mixture into a double boiler and heat on low until thick."
- "Remove from heat and put aside to cool. At least 2 hours or overnight."
- "Whip the cream until it forms soft peaks."
- "Fold the chocolate mixture into the whipped cream. Since the chocolate mixture is thick (very much like fudge) I find it easier to add the chocolate to the whipped cream by the spoonful and then folding it a little at a time. Once the all the chocolate has been folded into the whipped cream, it&#39;s ready to spoon it into the meringue shell."
- "Cover the pie with plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hours."
- "Before Serving, make the whipped cream topping. To do this, put the heavy cream, vanilla and sugar in a bowl and beat until the cream is stiff. Spread the whipped cream on top of the pie and sprinkle the top with grated chocolate."

<i>Before you jump to Chocolate Dream Pie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Climb stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? Most people will decide to be lazy and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the selections you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about reducing your weight. It is more about making your body as strong as it can be.
