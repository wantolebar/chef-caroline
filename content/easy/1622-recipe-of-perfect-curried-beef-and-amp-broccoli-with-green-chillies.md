- "Drain off the beef and place upon some kitchen towel to remove excess water. Heat up a large saucepan over a medium high heat and add in 1tbsp oil or some spray oil to cover the base entirely. Once hot add in the beef and begin to fry. After a couple of minutes add in the crushed garlic and dried spices (chilli powder, cumin, turmeric and garam masala), also add the fresh green chillies. Season with salt and pepper. Continue to fry and coat the beef in the spices."
- "Add in the tomato paste and stir through, then add in the broccoli florets, and the stevia. Toss together. Now pour in 400ml water and turn down the heat and bring to a simmer. Simmer until the water has reduced by around 90% and a sauce has been formed."
- "Serve up and add the garnishes, eat and enjoy with your choice of sides! :)"

<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a place get started on as any. Do this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. You should change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Along with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. It's about being practical, more often than not.
