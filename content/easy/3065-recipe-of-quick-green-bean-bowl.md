<i>Before you jump to Green bean bowl recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. Typically, all it requires is a little common sense.
