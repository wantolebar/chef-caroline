<i>Before you jump to Pav bhaji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is going. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
