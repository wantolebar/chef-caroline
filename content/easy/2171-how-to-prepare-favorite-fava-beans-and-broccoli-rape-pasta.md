Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good a place to begin with as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. You really need to change your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more initially, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. You also have to obtain the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll usually discover members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
