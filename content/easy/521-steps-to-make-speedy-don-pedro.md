<i>Before you jump to Don Pedro recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
