It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good an area to start as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area.

These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Making use of these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Along with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
