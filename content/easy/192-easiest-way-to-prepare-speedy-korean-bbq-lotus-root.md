Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Let's begin with something not that hard, changing the actual light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. You really need to upgrade your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Utilizing these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to acquire the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. A lot of it is basically utilizing common sense.
