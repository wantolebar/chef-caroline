recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the yuzu skin well and zest with a microplane or zester. You can also use a knife to carefully slice off the peel, then cut into small pieces. Try not to get any of the white part underneath the skin as it&#39;s a bit bitter."
- "Chop up the green chilis and add all ingredients to a  mortar &amp; pestle (Japanese suribachi if you have it) or a small food processor. Using a mortar &amp; pestle will bring out the fragrance and flavor of the citrus a bit better."

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Yuzu Kosho (Citrus Chili Paste) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and maybe this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. A lot of it truly is merely utilizing common sense.
