<i>Before you jump to Green leafy smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not really that hard. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
