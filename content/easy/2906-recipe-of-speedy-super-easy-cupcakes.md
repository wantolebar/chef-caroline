<i>Before you jump to Super Easy Cupcakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as efficiently as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to work less frequently, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. It's about being functional, more often than not.
