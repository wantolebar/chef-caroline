<i>Before you jump to 紅酒炆牛腩 (Red Wine Beef Brisket) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Do this for your house, not only the kitchen. You really need to upgrade your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more originally, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than simply swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The family spends major time in the kitchen, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This also takes place in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. It's about being practical, more often than not.
