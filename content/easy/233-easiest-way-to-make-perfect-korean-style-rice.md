<i>Before you jump to Korean style rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as efficiently as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that tough. A lot of it truly is basically making use of common sense.
