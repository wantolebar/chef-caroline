<i>Before you jump to Pandan Banana Pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These kinds of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
