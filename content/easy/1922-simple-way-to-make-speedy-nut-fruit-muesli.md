<i>Before you jump to Nut Fruit Muesli recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These kinds of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. It's about being practical, most of the time.
