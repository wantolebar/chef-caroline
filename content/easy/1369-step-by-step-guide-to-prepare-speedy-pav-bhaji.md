<i>Before you jump to Pav Bhaji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Let us begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen area. You should upgrade your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. You also have to acquire the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This also happens in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
