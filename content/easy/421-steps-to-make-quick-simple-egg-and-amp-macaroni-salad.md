<i>Before you jump to Simple egg &amp; macaroni salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less frequently, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
