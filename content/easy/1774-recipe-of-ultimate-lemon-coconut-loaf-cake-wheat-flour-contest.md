<i>Before you jump to Lemon - Coconut Loaf Cake #Wheat Flour contest # recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
