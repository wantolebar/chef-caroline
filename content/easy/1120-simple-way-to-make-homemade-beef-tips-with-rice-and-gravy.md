Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.
