<i>Before you jump to Oven BBQ Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Let's begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. Accomplish this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them in place of incandescent lights. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. A lot of it truly is merely making use of common sense.
