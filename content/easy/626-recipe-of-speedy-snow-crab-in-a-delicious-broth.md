Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as efficiently as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
