<i>Before you jump to Irish Potato Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Start out with changing the light bulbs. This will certainly go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. You need to replace your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Obviously this also happens in different rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not that tough. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
