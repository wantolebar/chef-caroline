Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as economically as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less frequently, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. It's concerning being sensible, most of the time.
