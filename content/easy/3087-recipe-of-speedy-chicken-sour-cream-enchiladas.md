recipeingredient:
- "3-4 cups cooked shredded chicken I used rotisserie chicken"
- "1 medium yellow or white onion chopped"
- "1 teaspoon olive oil"
- "1 cup sour cream"
- "1/2 cup chopped parsley"
- "1 large can enchilada sauce"
- "3 cups shredded cheese I use mexican blend"
- "6-10 flour tortillas"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre heat oven to 350 degrees"
- "In a large pan over medium heat, heat a teaspoon of olive oil. Add the onions and cook until translucent. Stir often. Combine chicken and onions in the frying pan. Stir until well combined."
- "Pour ½ cup of enchilada sauce over the chicken and onion mixture- just enough to coat the chicken."
- "Add the sour cream and parsley, stir until well combined."
- "Once the sour cream and parsley are fully combined, turn off the heat. Now add the shredded cheese. I usually add 2-3 cups sometimes more depending on how cheesy I want it. I like this mixture to be creamy and cheesy. Once the cheese is melted and combined with the chicken and sour cream mixture taste it to see if needs anything more. More sour cream? More cheese perhaps? More sauce? Adjust it how you want it."
- "Now it&#39;s time to fill the tortillas and make the enchiladas. (Spray your baking dish with non stick spray first.) Now just pour enough sauce in a baking dish to cover the bottom of the dish."
- "Now take a tortilla and spoon some sauce on the tortilla. Next spoon on some of the chicken mixture."
- "Roll up the tortilla and place it in the baking dish. Repeat steps to make enough tortillas to fill your baking dish or until the chicken mixture is used up."
- "Pour enchilada sauce over the completed enchiladas. Spread it evenly over the top."
- "Top with more shredded cheese and garnish with chopped parsley"
- "Now they are ready for the oven. Cover with foil and bake 20-30 minutes. Remove the foil for the last 10 minutes of cooking. Since the chicken is pre cooked, you only need to bake them long enough for the sauce to start bubbling, tortilla edges are slightly crisp and the cheese is melted."
- "Enjoy!!!!"

<i>Before you jump to Chicken Sour cream Enchiladas recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is done, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Make smart decisions when shopping for groceries. If you make smart choices when you are purchasing your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with crowded grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to get home immediately and have something great. Your kitchen should be stocked with healthy foods and ingredients. In this way, even when you choose that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Wanting to get in as much exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
