<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s 10 Minute Garlic Crab Lobster &amp; Shrimp Marisco recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
