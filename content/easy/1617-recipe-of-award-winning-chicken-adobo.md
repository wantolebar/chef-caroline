Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. As soon as you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, nonetheless that is not true. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it truly is simply using common sense.
