recipeingredient:
- "1 gallon fresh green beans trimmed"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "2 clove garlic peeled and split"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place cleaned, trimmed, and cut beans in a pot(each gallon of whole beans equals 1 pint -- I just eyeball the amount of beans with a 5-gallon bucket)."
- "Cover the beans with water."
- "Being the pot to a boil. Once it reaches boiling, allow the beans to boil for 5 minutes."
- "While the beans are boiling, sterilize a pint jar per gallon of beans in a separate pot of hot water (do not put cold jars in boiling water! Heat the jars in a few inches of water in the canning pot until the water boils. This doesn&#39;t just sterilize the jars, it also makes it so they won&#39;t break when you add the hot beans)."
- "Remove the jar with canning tongs. While the jar is still not, add 1/2 tsp salt and 2 split cloves of garlic."
- "Ladle hot beans into the jar. When it&#39;s full, push them down with a wooden spoon and add more until the jar is snugly packed."
- "Pour hit cooking liquid over the beans up to 1/2-inch below the rim of the jar."
- "Wipe the rim of the jar dry with a clean paper towel."
- "Place a clean, dry metal lid on the jar and screw on the metal ring on just until it stops turning."
- "Place the jar(s) in simmering water in the pressure canner. Add more water if necessary to bring the water up to about 2 inches up the sides of the jar(s)."
- "Process the jars on high for 20 minutes."

<i>Before you jump to Canned Garlic Green Beans recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as efficiently as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.

The kitchen alone offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
