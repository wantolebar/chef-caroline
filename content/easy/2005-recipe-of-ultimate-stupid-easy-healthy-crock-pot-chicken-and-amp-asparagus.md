<i>Before you jump to Stupid Easy (Healthy) Crock Pot Chicken &amp; Asparagus recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. A lot of it truly is simply using common sense.
