It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is not true. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is going. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, of course. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
