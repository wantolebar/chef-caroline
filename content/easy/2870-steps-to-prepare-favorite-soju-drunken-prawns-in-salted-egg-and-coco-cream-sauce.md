It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. It's about being practical, usually.
