Although costing a little more initially, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than merely swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that difficult. It's related to being sensible, more often than not.
