<i>Before you jump to Cabbage with Fennel Seeds Curry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Start with exchanging the bulbs. Complete this for your house, not merely the kitchen. You should upgrade your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Utilizing these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than just swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights especially are often left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
