<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many men and women wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
