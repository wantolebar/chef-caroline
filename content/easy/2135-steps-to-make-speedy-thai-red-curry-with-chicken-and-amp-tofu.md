<i>Before you jump to Thai Red Curry with Chicken &amp; Tofu recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Probably the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being practical, usually.
