recipeinstructions:
- "Crush your gingersnaps ahead of time so you can make crust quicker.  Crush cookies and mix with other crust dry ingredients, seal tightly and set aside until ready to use."
- "TO MAKE CRUST:  Line the bottom of a 9 or 10 - inch springfoam pan with parchment paper and coat with cooking spray.  In a large bowl, stir together the melted butter with the crushed gingersnaps, sugar and cinnamon.  Press into the bottom of the prepared pan, working some of it up the sides, if desired."
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F."
- "TO MAKE FILLING:  Using a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese in a large bowl on medium-high speed about 1 minute, until fluffy.  Add sugar and beat until smooth, about 1 minute.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating on medium-high speed for 20 seconds after each addition.  Add vanilla, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger; beat on medium speed about 1 minute, until incorporated."
- "Pour the filling over crust.  Tear off a large sheet of foil and place the springfoam pan in the center, carefully folding up the sides.  This prevents the waterbath (waterbaths prevent cracks) from seeping into your cheesecake and making the crust soggy.  Put the wrapped pan into a larger baking pan and set it on the center rack of the oven.  Pour enough boiling water into the larger pan to reach halfway up the sides of the springfoam pan (this is a waterbath)."
- "Bake about 1 hour, until the filling is set and golden brown on top.  It should barely jiggle when the pan is gently slid.  Cool the cheesecake on a rack about 30 minutes, then remove from waterbath and chill for several hours or overnight.  Remove the cheesecake from the springfoam pan and set it on a large serving plate.  Make sure the plate is big enough to hold any of the praline sauce that drips over the top."
- "TO MAKE PRALINE TOPPING:  Prevent the oven to 350°F."
- "Arrange the pecans in a single layer and toast them for 7-9 minutes, until golden brown and aromatic.  Coarsely chop the nuts.  Stir together the brown sugar, cream and butter in a sauce pan over medium heat.  Boil the mixture for about 1 1/2 minutes, adjusting the heat to make sure it does not boil over.  DO NOT STIR.  Remove the pan from heat and stir in vanilla, salt and pecans."
- "Cool the topping at least 15 minutes before pouring over the top of the chilled cheesecake."
- "Serve immediately or cover and chill until ready to serve.  The cheesecake will keep, well wrapped in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days."

<i>Before you jump to Pumpkin Cheesecake with Gingersnap crust &amp; Praline Caramel topping recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is finished, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Walk up the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Don't ignore that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
