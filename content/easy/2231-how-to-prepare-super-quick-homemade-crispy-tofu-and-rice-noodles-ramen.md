Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
