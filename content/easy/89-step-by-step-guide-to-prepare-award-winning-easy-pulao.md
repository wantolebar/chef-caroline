<i>Before you jump to Easy pulao recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that difficult. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
