recipeingredient:
- " The Bread"
- "500 grams flour I used a malted strong flour but you can use plain"
- "5 grams salt"
- "10 grams bicarbonate of soda"
- "375 ml milk"
- "25 ml cider vinegar"
- " The Soup"
- "1 tbsp sunflower oil"

- "3 small potatos"
- "500 ml hot water"
- "1 stock cube I used chicken"
- "1 dash thyme"
- "1 dash cracked pepper"
- "1 dash freshly grated nutmeg"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 200° celcius; grease a 1-pound loaf tin with some sunflower oil"
- "Mix the flour, salt and bicarb in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour in the milk and vinegar, then combine into a wet sticky dough with your hands"
- "Place the dough onto a floured surface and work it into a rough ball - it&#39;ll still look pretty porridge-y but put it into your greased tin and pop the tin into the oven for 30 minutes"
- "Meanwhile, heat the rest of the sunflower oil in a saucepan"

- "Pour enough hot water to cover all the vegetables and stir in your stock cube (or you could use liquid stock instead of a stock cube and water). Add the herbs and season to taste"
- "Turn the heat up and bring the soup to a boil, then lower heat and simmer the soup until the root vegetables are soft"
- "When your bread is done, remove from oven and cool on a wire rack. The bread should be a nice deep gold colour."
- "Once all the vegetables are soft, remove the soup from the heat and purée with a stick blender. Once blended ensure you taste the soup again and season to taste"
- "Serve the soup with a couple of slices of your delicious bread!"

<i>Before you jump to Root Vegetable Soup with Irish Soda Bread recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, nonetheless that is definitely not true. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. It's related to being functional, more often than not.
