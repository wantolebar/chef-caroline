<i>Before you jump to Chicken congee recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as effectively as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that tough. It's related to being sensible, more often than not.
