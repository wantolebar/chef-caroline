<i>Before you jump to Vickys Coconut Flour Victoria Sandwich Cake, GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as efficiently as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
