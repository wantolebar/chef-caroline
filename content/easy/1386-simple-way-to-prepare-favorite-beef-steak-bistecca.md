recipeingredient:
- " Beef loin or sirloin"
- " Salt natural"
- " Black pepper"
- " Olive oil"
- " Garlic"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the ingredients. Take the beef out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before you cook it, so it gets close to room temperature. This is the biggest key to this recipe!"
- "Season the room temperature steak on both sides generously with salt and pepper. (Press it in with your hands so that it doesn&#39;t fall off as the steak cooks!)"
- "Heat a pan until it&#39;s smoking lightly, and add the steak. Put in the garlic too. The heat should be about medium-high!"
- "Brown well on both sides."
- "When the garlic turns brown, put it on the meat."
- "If the meat is springs back when you press it, it&#39;s done."
- "The second key: Wrap the cooked steak in aluminium foil and leave it to rest in a warm place, such as near the cooktop."
- "When you press down on the steak with your finger, it will spring back more than before. If it no longer feels like raw meat, slice it up! If the meat juices don&#39;t spurt out of the steak, it&#39;s a success."
- "Slice thickly and serve!"
- "This is a great main dish. It&#39;s also delicious with lemon juice or balsamic vinegar. Wasabi soy sauce is great too!"
- "To summarize: 1. Have the steak at room temperature before you cook it. If it&#39;s still cold, the meat will be tough, and won&#39;t cook through properly to the middle!"
- "2. Season generously with salt and pepper, and heat in the pan until it&#39;s smoking slightly. Smear the oil on the steak rather than putting it in the pan."
- "3. After the steak is seared evenly, wrap in aluminium foil and rest in a warm place. It&#39;s done if it springs back when you press the steak in the middle with your finger."
- "You should rest the steak for as long as you cooked it. If the steak is thin, just sear the outside and rest for a little while. ♪"

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently.

Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.
