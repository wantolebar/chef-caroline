<i>Before you jump to Fettucine alfredo w/shrimp, andouille sausage, and mushrooms recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
