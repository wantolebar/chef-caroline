recipeingredient:
- " warm water about 110F"
- " active dry yeast"
- " granulated sugar"
- " olive oil  additional for drizzling"
- " bread flour"
- " salt"
- " all purpose flour for dusting the work surface"
- " cornmeal for dusting the pizza tray"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the yeast and sugar in a large bowl. Pour the water over them and whisk to combine. Make sure the water is between 100°-110°F. Let that sit for 2-10 minutes to activate the yeast. You&#39;ll know it&#39;s ready when it gets a bit bubbly and foamy on top."
- "Use a wooden spoon to stir in the 2 tbsp. of olive oil and half the bread flour. Once that incorporates a bit, add in the salt and remaining bread flour. Stir until you get it as combined as you can, in a loose ball, then lightly flour your hands and knead the dough together in the bowl a bit."
- "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface (I just use my countertop). Knead the dough for about 10 minutes. Sprinkle more flour onto the work surface and your hands as needed, if the dough begins to stick. To see if you&#39;ve kneaded enough, you can press two fingers gently into the dough. If the indentations stay after you move your fingers, then it&#39;s been kneaded enough and is ready for the next step."
- "Drizzle some olive oil into the bottom of a separate large bowl. Place the dough ball in and roll it around to evenly coat all the sides in the oil. Loosely cover the top of the dough with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for 1 - 1 1/2 hours. It should be double in size once it&#39;s ready."
- "Preheat the oven to 450°F. Lightly spray a 16&#34; pizza pan with non-stick cooking spray and dust it lightly with cornmeal. Set aside."
- "The dough should have risen. Punch it gently to release some air, then turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Lightly dust a rolling pin with flour and gently roll out each side, keeping it in a nice rounded shape."
- "Once it looks Iike the right size for your pizza pan, carefully transfer it onto your prepared pan. I do this by folding half of the dough over itself, then sliding the pizza tray under that half. Once it&#39;s on, gently unfold the dough and use your fingers to gently stretch it to fill the pan."
- "Use a fork and poke some holes all across the dough. This should prevent any bubbles from forming."
- "Top with your desired toppings, leaving an inch or so of space around the edges for the crust."
- "Bake for 14-18 minutes, until the cheese and crust are nice and golden. Be sure to keep an eye on it towards the end."
- "Allow to cool 5 minutes, then slice and serve!"

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Pizza Dough recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Take the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are a good deal of things that work toward your getting healthy. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Wanting to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Don't overlook that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You really want your body to be powerful too.
