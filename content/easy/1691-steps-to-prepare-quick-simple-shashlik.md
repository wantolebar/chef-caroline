<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Cash</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as effectively as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. It's about being functional, more often than not.
