<i>Before you jump to Honey Chipotle Chicken poppers recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Begin with changing the lights. Accomplish this for the whole house, not just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Of course this also happens in different rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that hard. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
