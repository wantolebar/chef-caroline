- "Place the filling ingredients on top of the egg mixture. (In the picture, I used 1/2 onion, 1 small eggplant, 1/2 zucchini, and 2 slices of bacon. 1 slice of quiche = 100 calories.)"
- "Cover with the remaining egg mixture and flatten it out. Drop the quiche 2 or 3 times from a distance of about 10 cm to release the air pockets."
- "Bake for 20-25 minutes in the 200°C oven and enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Easy But Healthy Quiche with Tofu for Dieters recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is done, most people do not want to go to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Drink water, not alternative drinks. Soda and coffee, when consumed in moderation, aren't that bad. Getting most of your hydration from them is a awful idea. When you pick out water over other beverages you are helping your body remain very healthful and hydrated. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Effective weight loss efforts often depend solely on water consumption.

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about reducing your weight. It has more to do with making your body as strong as it can be.
