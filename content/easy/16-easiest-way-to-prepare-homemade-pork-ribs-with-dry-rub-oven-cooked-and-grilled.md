<i>Before you jump to Pork Ribs with dry rub (oven cooked and grilled) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it requires is a little common sense.
