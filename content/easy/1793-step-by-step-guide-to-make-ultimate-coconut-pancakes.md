<i>Before you jump to Coconut Pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you make certain the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, after all. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
