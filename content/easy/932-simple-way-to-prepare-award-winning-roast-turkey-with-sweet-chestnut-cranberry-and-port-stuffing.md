- " cranberries"
- " small bunch fresh sage"
- " small bunch fresh thyme"
- " limes zest of"
- " sausages"
- " breadcrumbs"
- " large onion"
- " port"
- " cava optional"
- " fresh ginger"

recipeinstructions:
- "Soak the cranberries in port and grated ginger for at least an hour"
- "Put the chestnuts on to boil for half an hour or so, leave them to cool and then peel them (I did this the evening before and once peeled, put them in the fridge)"
- "If you are going to make stock, put the turkey bones (or neck and giblets) into a large pan with some celery sticks, a leek, a couple of onions, 2 carrots, some bayleaves, generous pinch of salt, a large piece of peeled ginger and water (should almost cover ingredients). Covered and simmered for a couple of hours. This provided heaps of stock, some of which I put into the freezer for future soups, and some of which I put in the fridge for Christmas Day gravy."
- "Chop the onion, celery and garlic as small as poss. Chop the walnuts and chestnuts and grate the bread. Wash and chop the herbs and get the meat out of the sausages."
- "Sauté the onions and garlic in a little oil for about five minutes."
- "Add the sausage meat and stir"
- "Add the port and cranberries and leave to simmer for 10 minutes. (I had an opened bottle of cava in the fridge so couldn&#39;t resist adding a slosh of that too)"
- "Add the nuts and breadcrumbs, stir well and simmer another 5-10 minutes until the liquid has been absorbed"
- "Add the herbs, stir well, cover and leave covered for 5 minutes more."
- "Taste and add salt and black pepper accordingly. Put in an airtight container and store in the fridge if it is for future use. Or just start stuffing if you are doing the whole marathon in one go."
- "This is what the stock looked like after 2 hours."
- "Preheat the oven to 250º. Stuff your turkey (or bird of choice). I used string to tie ours but this isn&#39;t strictly necessary and I wouldn&#39;t have done so if it hadn&#39;t been deboned."
- "Put the turkey in the oven, I put it in like this, with the baking sheet underneath to catch all the juices. After the first 30 minutes, put the heat down to 180º and then cooking time will be proportional to the size of your turkey - roughly 30 minutes per kg."
- "To check that the turkey is done, stick a prong just above the leg. If the juices that come out are clear, it is fully cooked."
- "Leave the turkey to rest for half an hour before carving"
- "While it is resting, heat the stock up and carefully pour the juices into the pan to make the gravy. Get your veg ready"
- "And put your par-boiled potatoes and parsnips in the baking sheet. Add salt and pepper and put in a very hot oven (25º) for half an hour so they crisp up nicely."
- "Serve the carved turkey on large warmed plates so that family and friends can serve themselves. Enjoy and Happy Christmas!!!"

<i>Before you jump to Roast turkey with sweet chestnut, cranberry and port stuffing recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty straightforward to live green, of course. A lot of it really is merely making use of common sense.
