<i>Before you jump to Easy Zuccini - Potato Tots recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
