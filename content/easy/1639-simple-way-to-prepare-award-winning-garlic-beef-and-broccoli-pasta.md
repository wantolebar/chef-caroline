<i>Before you jump to Garlic Beef and Broccoli Pasta recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically effective when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that tough. It's related to being functional, usually.
