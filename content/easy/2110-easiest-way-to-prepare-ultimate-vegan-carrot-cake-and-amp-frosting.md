<i>Before you jump to Vegan Carrot Cake (&amp; Frosting) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a spot to start as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. You should change your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that tough. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
