These kinds of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly.

Start with exchanging the bulbs. Do this for the whole house, not merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them rather than incandescent lights. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. You also have to obtain the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The kitchen lights specifically will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and discover just how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. It's related to being practical, usually.
