<i>Before you jump to OCB..Oat, Cottage Cheese and Banana Flapjack/Pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Start out with exchanging the light bulbs. This will go outside of the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you must use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more originally, these bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to acquire the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Obviously this also happens in some other rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that hard. It's about being practical, most of the time.
