recipeingredient:
- "150 grams without the core Cabbage"
- "1/3 bunch Chinese chives"
- "150 grams Ground pork I recommend a fatty portion"
- "1 Egg"
- "1 tsp Chinese soup stock base"
- "1 tsp Soy sauce"
- "1 tsp Sesame oil"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "1/2 tsp Grated garlic"
- "20 Gyoza skins large"
recipeinstructions:
- "Roughly chop the cabbage, and finely chop the chives. Put both into a bowl. Add all the other ingredients except for the gyoza skins, knead and mix together."
- "Wrap the filling in the skins (be generous with the filling). Put a piece of plastic wrap on a work surface or dust with flour, and line the formed dumplings on top."
- "Heat a frying pan with vegetable oil. Line up the gyoza dumplings in the pan. (You don&#39;t have to brown them at this point). Once the dumplings are in the pan..."
- "Add 100 ml of water (if you want to make &#34;wings,&#34; dissolve 2 teaspoons of flour in the water first) to the pan, cover with a lid, lower the heat a bit and cook for 4 to 5 minutes."
- "When the dumplings have plumped up, the skins should be translucent enough so that you can see water inside the dumplings boiling away. Make sure that almost all the water in the pan has evaporated..."
- "...then drizzle in vegetable or sesame oil, raise the heat a bit, and crisp up the bottom of the dumplings and the &#34;wings.&#34; Lift up and peek at the edges to make sure the bottoms are browned. If they look crispy and golden, they&#39;re done."
- "To freeze them: Line a shallow container with plastic wrap and put the gyoza dumplings in a single layer on top. Put in the freezer. When the surface is hard and frozen, transfer to plastic bags and put back in the freezer. They are uncooked and don&#39;t last that long, so use them up quickly."
- "To defrost or thaw them: Just cook them as you would freshly made dumplings. Make sure the dumplings reach the stage described in Step 5. If the insides are still cold they will be awful."
- "If you are going to make the skins yourself, see- &#34;Ultra-Easy Gyoza Skins&#34;"
