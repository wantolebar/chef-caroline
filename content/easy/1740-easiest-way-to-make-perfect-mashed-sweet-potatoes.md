<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

You may prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
