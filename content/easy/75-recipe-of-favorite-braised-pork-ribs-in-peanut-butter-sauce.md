- "2 lbs Pork Ribs"
- " Salt about 14 TBS and pepper"
- "2 big cloves of garlic finely minced"
- "1/3 cup soy sauce"
- "1/3 cup Peanut Butter"
- "1/2 cup sugar"

- "1/2 of a small carrot julienned"
- " Some chopped green onion and cilantro"
- " Some crushed peanuts"
recipeinstructions:
- "Do you see how fine the cabbage is? It’s not because I am that good with knives. It is from the help of this gadget. Saw it on Sachie ‘s kitchen. Later I added some julienned carrots, chopped green onion and cilantro with some peanut dressing to go with the ribs."
- "Put garlic, sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of ribs. Massage the ribs well and let them rest for 10 minutes"
- "Meanwhile, put soy sauce, vinegar, peanut butter and sugar in a bowl. Mix well to melt sugar. Put aside 5 TBS of sauce, 2 for glazing and 3 for slaw dressing later."
- "Sear the ribs until golden brown with some oil on a pan at high heat. About 3 to 4 minutes for each side."
- "After ribs are golden brown, turn heat to low. Pour the peanut sauce evenly over ribs, put lid on and slowly cooked for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Remember to flip the ribs over from time to time for the seasoning to really get into the meat."
- "After the ribs are done, remove ribs from pan. Strain the dripping from pan into a small saucepan or pot with 2 TBS of peanut sauce. Stir over medium low heat to thicken glaze for about 10 seconds. Turn off heat."
- "For slaw dressing, put 3 TBS of peanut sauce in small bowl. Add little more sugar and the juice of a 3/4 lime. Mix well."
- "Put some slaw and ribs on plate. Drizzle dressing on slaw. Pour some glazing over ribs and sprinkle some crushed peanuts on tops. Go well with all kinds of rice or just like that if you are watching starch intake:)"
- "It was finger licking good to me. Hope you all like it too:)"

<i>Before you jump to Braised Pork Ribs in Peanut Butter Sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is finished, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Water is the very best beverage out there. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every occasionally isn’t a bad idea. It is definitely, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. Choosing water as an alternative to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Water is often the main element to successful weight reduction and healthfulness.

There are a good deal of things that contribute to your getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Looking to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your lifestyle choices. You really want your body to be strong too.
