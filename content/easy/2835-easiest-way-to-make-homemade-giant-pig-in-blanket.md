<i>Before you jump to Giant pig in blanket! recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as economically as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that hard. It's about being functional, most of the time.
