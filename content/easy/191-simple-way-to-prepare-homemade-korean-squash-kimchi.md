You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work.

If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthful.

Walk up the stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor.
