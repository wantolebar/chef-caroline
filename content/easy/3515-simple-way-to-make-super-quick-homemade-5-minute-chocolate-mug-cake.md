<i>Before you jump to 5 Minute Chocolate Mug Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is done, most people do not want to go to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Run the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a whole lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. It’s about making your body as powerful as it can be.
