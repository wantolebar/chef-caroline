Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as efficiently as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, of course. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
