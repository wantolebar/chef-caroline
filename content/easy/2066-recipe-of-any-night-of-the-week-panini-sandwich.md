<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of electrical power is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
