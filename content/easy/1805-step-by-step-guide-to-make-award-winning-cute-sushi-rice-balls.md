<i>Before you jump to Cute Sushi Rice Balls recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A massive amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that tough. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
