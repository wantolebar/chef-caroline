<i>Before you jump to Oreo chocolate tart with fruit puree recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a whole lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. You need your body to be powerful too.
