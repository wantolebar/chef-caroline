<i>Before you jump to Prawns with chili lime butter sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. A lot of it is basically utilizing common sense.
