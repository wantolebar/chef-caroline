<i>Before you jump to Lebkuchen (German Gingerbread) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Start with exchanging the bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and see how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
