It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less frequently, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that tough. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
