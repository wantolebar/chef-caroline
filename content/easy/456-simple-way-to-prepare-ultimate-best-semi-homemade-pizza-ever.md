<i>Before you jump to Best semi-homemade pizza EVER! recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Probably the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is definitely not true. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen alone gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
