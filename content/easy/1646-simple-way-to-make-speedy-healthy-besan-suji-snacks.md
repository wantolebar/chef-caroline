Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you make certain the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, after all. It's related to being sensible, more often than not.
