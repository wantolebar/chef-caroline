<i>Before you jump to Easy Basic Plain Muffin recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. These kinds of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Start with changing the bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. You really need to replace your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than merely exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The family spends a lot of time in the cooking area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
