Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies?

Changing light bulbs is as good an area to begin with as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you will need to use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. This likewise occurs in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, after all. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
