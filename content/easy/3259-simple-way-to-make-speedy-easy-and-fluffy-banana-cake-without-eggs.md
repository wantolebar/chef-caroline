These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently.

The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.
