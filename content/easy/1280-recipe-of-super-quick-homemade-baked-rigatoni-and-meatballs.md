- "1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese"
- " Sauce"
- "1 tbsp. olive oil"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "3 cans (8 oz.) each unsalted tomato sauce"
- "1/4 cup heavy cream"
- "1 tsp. each dried basil dried parsley"

- "1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese"
- "1 large egg"
- "1 tsp. dried parsley"
- "1/2 tsp. each salt pepper onion powder garlic powder basil"
- "1 tbsp. olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "First thing to do is get your sauce going. In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Once it&#39;s hot, add the garlic. Cook and stir just until it&#39;s fragrant... only a minute or two. Then pour in the tomato sauce, cream, sugar and seasonings. Once it starts to simmer, reduce the heat down to low and start preparing the meatballs."
- "For the meatballs, place the ground beef, breadcrumbs, cheese, egg and seasonings into a large bowl. Use your hands to mix and incorporate everything together. Then roll the meat mixture into mini meatballs. Heat the oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Once it&#39;s hot, add the meatballs to the skillet in batches. Cook and roll them around in the skillet every few minutes until they are browned on all sides. Then remove them from the skillet and stir them gently into the sauce."
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x13&#34; baking pan and set it aside. Heat a large pot of salted water over high heat. Once it begins to boil, stir in the rigatoni pasta and cook according to package directions, until al dente. Drain and return to the pot. Then stir the ricotta cheese into the hot pasta. Add the sauce and meatballs to the pot and stir it all together. Then turn it out into the greased pan and sprinkle the mozzarella cheese evenly over the top."
- "Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, or until heated through and the cheese has a nice golden color. Serve immediately."
- "If you only wanted to bake a smaller serving at a time, you could turn out the pasta mixture into two greased 8x8&#34;baking pans instead of the larger 9x13&#34;. Top one with cheese and cook it immediately. Let the second one cool down completely, then top with the cheese, wrap it up tightly and place it in the freezer. The night before you&#39;re planning on baking it, place it in the fridge to thaw out overnight, then bake it for 30-40 minutes or until 165°F throughout. Each 8x8&#34; pan will serve 4 people."

<i>Before you jump to Baked Rigatoni and Meatballs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Climb stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get wholesome. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
