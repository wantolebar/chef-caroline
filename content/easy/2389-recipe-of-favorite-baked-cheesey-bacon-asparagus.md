<i>Before you jump to baked cheesey bacon asparagus recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Start with exchanging the bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them in place of incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently discover members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in different rooms, not simply the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, after all. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
