recipeingredient:
- "540 ml Uncooked white rice 3 rice cooker cups  540 ml"
- "1/2 tbsp Salt natural salt"
- "5 tbsp Vinegar"
- "4 tbsp Sugar"
- "5 to 10 cm square piece Kombu for dashi stock"
recipeinstructions:
- "[I made 5 rice cooker cups worth this time] Pour in a little less water than usual to cook the rice. Add the kombu and leave the rice to soak for at least 30 minutes."
- "Add the salt to the rice cooker and mix lightly. Use the &#34;sushi rice&#34; setting (or if your rice cooker doesn&#39;t have one, just use the regular setting) to cook the rice."
- "Mix the vinegar and sugar together. ※Microwave just before adding it to the rice to about 40-50°C, and mix well to dissolve the sugar."
- "When the rice is cooked, take out the kombu and invert the rice cooker bowl to take out the rice into a plastic container or bowl. Swirl in the warm sushi vinegar from Step 3, and quickly mix it into the rice in a cutting motion."
- "Cover the container or bowl with a lid and leave for 7 minutes to steam and let the rice absorb the flavors. If the bowl doesn&#39;t have a lid, use a pot lid or a cutting board to cover."
- "Remove the lid, and mix the rice using a cut-and-fold motion while fanning it to cool it down. (This will make the rice glossy)."
- "If you are making chirashi sushi, mix the ingredients in while the rice is still warm. If you&#39;re making sushi rolls, let the rice cool down to about body temperature first."
- "I made Western style chirashi sushi this time:  https://cookpad.com/en/recipes/188384-western-style-chirashi-sushi-a-popular-school-lunch-item. The additional ingredients are easy so you can make this sushi anytime you like."
- "This is the big plastic container my mother uses, that has seen many years of service. I borrowed it from her this time I made 5 rice cooker cups&#39; worth of rice this time. Normally I make less, so I just use a regular bowl to mix the rice."

<i>Before you jump to Let&#39;s Make Delicious Sushi Rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the conclusion of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Water is the most effective drinks out there. Soda and coffee, when consumed in moderation, aren't that bad. Getting all of your hydration from them is a awful idea. Drinking water instead of other kinds of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories from your diet— without having to be forced to eat terrible tasting diet food. Effective weight loss efforts often depend entirely on water ingestion.

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Trying to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need to help to make your body as strong you can make it.
