You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave.

Many men and women mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.
