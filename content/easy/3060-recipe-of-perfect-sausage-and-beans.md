<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it truly is merely using common sense.
