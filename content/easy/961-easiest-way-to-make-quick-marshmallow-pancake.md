<i>Before you jump to Marshmallow Pancake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
