You really need to change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house at the same time. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. A lot of it truly is basically using common sense.
