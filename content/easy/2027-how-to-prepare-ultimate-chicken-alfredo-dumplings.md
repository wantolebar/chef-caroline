<i>Before you jump to Chicken Alfredo Dumplings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
