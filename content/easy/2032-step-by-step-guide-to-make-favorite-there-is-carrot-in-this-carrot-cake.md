recipeinstructions:

- "Dissolve miso in 150ml of hot water.  Gradually, while stirring, add in the miso stock.  Stir until well combined.  Now, you should get a smooth thick, but not runny, consistency.  *Make sure no large lumps.*"
- "Add in the carrots, radish and salt.  Mix until well combined.  Transfer into a lightly greased heat proof bowl.  In a skillet over medium heat, add water."
- "Place the bowl of batter into the skillet.  Stir until the mixture starts to thicken.  Once it gets too difficult to stir.  Remove from heat and smoothen the surface."
- "Steam the batter in a steamer for about 10 to 15 mins or until harden.  Remove from heat and set aside to cool completely.  Once cooled, unmold the rice cake and finely dice into small cubes. Set aside."
- "For the plain version.  In a skillet over medium heat, add oil.  Once the oil is heated up, add in the garlic and radish.  Saute until aromatic.  Add in a handful of the rice cake cubes."
- "Saute until well combined and lightly browned and crisped on all sides.  Form the rice cake cubes into a circle.  In a small bowl, whisk eggs, sambal, salt, pepper, mushroom powder and nori flakes until well combined."
- "Add the egg mixture into the skillet over the rice cake cubes.  Cook until bottom is lightly browned.  Flip the omelette onto a plate and slide back into the skillet."
- "Cook the other side until lightly browned.  Transfer onto serving plate and garnish with scallions.  Serve immediately."
- "For the dark version.  In a skillet over medium heat, add oil.  Once the oil is heated up, add in the garlic and radish.  Saute until aromatic.  Add in a handful of the rice cake cubes."
- "Saute until well combined and lightly browned and crisped on all sides.  Form the rice cake cubes into a circle.  In a small bowl, whisk eggs, molasses, salt, pepper, mushroom powder and nori flakes until well combined."
- "Add the egg mixture into the skillet over the rice cake cubes.  Cook until bottom is lightly blackened, but not burnt. It is the molasses caramelizing.  Flip the omelette onto a plate and slide back into the skillet."
- "Cook the other side until lightly blackened, but not burnt.  Transfer onto serving plate and garnish with scallions.  Serve immediately."
- "If you want the same as the plating.  Preheat oven to 180 degrees celsius or 360 fahrenheit.  Lined parchment paper onto a baking tray.  Wash 2 carrots thoroughly.  Trim off the roots and leaves."
- "Rub the carrots with canola oil and grated garlic.  Transfer onto the prepped baking tray.  Wack into the oven and bake for 15 mins or until the carrots are fork tender.  *If the garlic browned before the carrots are baked, remove the garlic and transfer into a small bowl. Do not discard.*"
- "Remove from oven and set aside.  Divide the scallion into 2 parts, green and white.  Blanch the green part in a pot of boiling water for 1 min.  Strain and transfer into a blender."
- "Add just enuff canola oil to get the blender blitzing.  Blitz until smooth.  Pour thru a fine strainer over a small bowl.  Discard the residue. The scallion oil is done."
- "For the white part, finely julienne into fine shreds. You can do this with a special peeler or a knife.  Plunge the shreds into a bowl of ice water.  It will curl up after a while. I learnt this trick from Yui Miles."
- "Spoon the scallion oil and move your spoon swiftly in a circular motion.  Place the roasted the carrots onto the scallion oil.  Using a cookie cutter, cut out 2 discs from the plain and dark version of carrot cakes."
- "Transfer onto serving plate.  Garnish with the curled white scallions.  Spoon the roasted garlic bits and some more of the preserved radish onto the side.  Serve immediately."

<i>Before you jump to There Is Carrot In This Carrot Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Start with changing the bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more initially, these bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not just the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
