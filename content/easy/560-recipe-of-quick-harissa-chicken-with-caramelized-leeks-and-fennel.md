- "4 bonein skinon chicken thighs"
- "12 oz new potatoes about 12"
- "2 Tbsp harissa"
- "2-3 leeks"
- "1 bulb fennel"
- "4 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 tsp sugar"
- "1 lemon juiced 3 tbsp"
- " Olive oil"
- " Salt"
- " Black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 425째F"
- "Begin by salting the chicken and laying it skin side down in a cold skillet. Arrange the potatoes into the void spaces. Place over medium heat (3.8/6) for 18-25 minutes until the chicken skin browns and releases itself from the pan. This is the most patient part. If the chicken doesn&#39;t come off with relative ease using a spatula, leave it cook."
- "While the chicken is cooking, prepare the leeks. Remove any shriveled outter leaves and slice the leeks lengthwise and wash them under water to remove any sand in the leaves."
- "Cut the dark green tips off the leeks leaving the light green and white parts. Slice the leeks and add to a bowl"
- "Pick the fronds off the fennel and save them. We&#39;ll use them as a garnish later."
- "Cut the stalks off the fennel and discard."
- "Thinly slice the first 1/3 of the bulb and add to the leeks. Add the garlic to the leeks as well."
- "Slice the remaining leeks as thin as possible. If you have a mandolin, now is the time to use it. 1/16 inch slices. Place in another bowl. We&#39;ll dress this later as a raw salad on top of the chicken."
- "When the chicken releases from the pan, turn the heat off, remove the chicken and potatoes to a plate, leaving the rendered fat in the pan."
- "Add the harissa paste to the pan of hot chicken fat and stir to make a schmaltz."
- "Put the harissa schmaltz into a small bowl. Add 2 Tbsp of lemon juice and stir."
- "Return the pan to medium heat, add some olive oil and the leeks, fennel, and garlic. Season with salt and sprinkle the sugar on top. Carmelize the leeks over ~20 min, adding a bit of water if they begin to stick and burn."
- "When the leeks have cooked down and caramelized, add the chicken and potatoes to the skillet, skin side up. Roast ~10 min until the chicken thighs are cooked (165째F). Remove from oven."
- "Toss the fennel with a little salt, some pepper, 1 Tbsp lemon juice, and a drizzle of olive oil."
- "Add the fennel salad to the skillet. Drizzle the schmaltz over the chicken and garnish with the fronds and serve at the table in the skillet."

<i>Before you jump to Harissa Chicken with Caramelized Leeks and Fennel recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is going. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
