<i>Before you jump to Baby marrow salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. It's about being functional, most of the time.
