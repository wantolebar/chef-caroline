<i>Before you jump to Egg and beef sandwich recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as efficiently as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that hard. It's concerning being practical, more often than not.
