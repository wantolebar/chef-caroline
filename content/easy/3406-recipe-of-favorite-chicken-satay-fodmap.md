<i>Before you jump to Chicken Satay FODMAP recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

You may possibly prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. As soon as you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is specifically effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that hard. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
