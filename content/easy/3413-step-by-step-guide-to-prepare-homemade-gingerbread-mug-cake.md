<i>Before you jump to Gingerbread Mug Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Begin with replacing the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. You should change your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than simply swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently discover members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and discover how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, of course. It's about being functional, usually.
