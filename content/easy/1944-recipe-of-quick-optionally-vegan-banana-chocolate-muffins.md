recipeingredient:
- "2 bananas"
- "1.5 cup plain flour"
- "0.5 cup sugar"
- "0.5 cup nut milk"
- "0.25 cup oil"
- "1 tsp baking soda"
- "0.25 tsp salt"
- " For chocolate ones add"
- "3 tbsp cocoa powder"
- "100 g dark chocolate 1 bar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mash bananas with a fork in a large bowl"
- "If you&#39;re making chocolate muffins, smash the chocolate bar into pieces with a mallet. Remove the foil first. It is easier when frozen and the bar is thin (Lindt chocolate)."
- "Preheat the oven for 180°C/356°C"
- "Add all the dry ingredients to the bowl (chocolate pieces, flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt) and give it a mix. The baking soda needs to spread evenly through the mixture to not get activated by moisture."
- "Add all the liquid ingredients (milk, oil)"
- "Mix all with a large wooden spoon. You will use it to fill the moulds later."
- "Prepare muffin moulds on a baking tray. I use silicone ones from IKEA as they are reusable, you can fit all on one tray and don&#39;t need a special tray. But you can also use waxed paper moulds on a flat tray OR regular paper moulds in a muffin tray. If you have only regular paper moulds and flat tray, use two moulds for one muffin."
- "Fill the moulds to roughly 75% each. The muffins will grow!"
- "Bake on 180°C/356°C for 20-30 minutes."
- "Use a skewer to check if the muffins are done. Pierce a few of the muffins in the middle and if there is no dough left on the skewer, they are done."

<i>Before you jump to Optionally Vegan, Banana Chocolate Muffins recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

When you go grocery shopping, be smart about it. Making good decisions when obtaining groceries means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to cope with a chaotic store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You’re going to go home and cook what you have in the cupboards. Fill your pantry shelves with wholesome foods. This makes it simple to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get wholesome. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent about the choices you make each day is a start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. You want your body to be strong too.
