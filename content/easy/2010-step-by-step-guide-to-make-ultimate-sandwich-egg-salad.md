recipeinstructions:
- "Hard boil eggs if you don&#39;t have any: Boil enough water to entirely cover eggs, CAREFULLY place eggs in water (with a sifter or something, good eggs sink and will crack if dropped in) and bring down to simmer. 12 minutes later take the eggs out and place into cool water until cool enough to handle. HB eggs last a week."
- "Chop your eggs before you add mayonnaise. Take a yolk out if you are trying to be healthier. Toast the bread while you mix up mayonnaise and chopped egg, add salt/pepper to taste"
- "Spread on toast, eat, and be happy :D. You get about 1 sandwich per egg (I guess it depends of the size of the bread and eggs). Only use 1 piece of bread and use as a spread if you are trying to eat less. DOES NOT LAST LONG so eat there and then. Not a sandwich you send you kid to school with for lunch. Good protein snack."

<i>Before you jump to Sandwich: Egg Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

When you go grocery shopping, be sensible about it. If you make smart choices when you are shopping for your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. At the end of your day do you really want to deal with packed grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to get home quickly and have something great. Fill your cupboards with nutritious foods. This way—even if you choose something slightly greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still choosing foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. You want your body to be powerful too.
