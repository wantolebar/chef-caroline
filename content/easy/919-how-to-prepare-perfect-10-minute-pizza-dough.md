recipeingredient:
- "1 1/2 cup self raising flour"
- "1 cup natural yoghurt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the yoghurt and flour in a bowl to form a dough (even though it says a full cup of yoghurt I usually use just under a full cup)"
- "Transfer dough to a surface (I usually use my chopping board) and knead the dough with more self raising flour for 7 minutes adding more flour when it starts to stick"
- "Roll out and create your pizza and enjoy. You can roll it straight away but it tends to spring back because the gluten has tightened. So I tend to leave it covered for about 10-20 minutes as it makes it easier to roll out."

<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
