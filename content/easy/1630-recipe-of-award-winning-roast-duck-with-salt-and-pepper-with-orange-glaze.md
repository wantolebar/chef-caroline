<i>Before you jump to Roast Duck with Salt and Pepper with Orange Glaze recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it truly is basically making use of common sense.
