<i>Before you jump to Pancetta and poached egg on toasted oregano bread recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Go up the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will decide to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also important. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your lifestyle choices. You need to make your body as strong as possible.
