recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until translucent, 3-4 minutes. Add in the garlic and cook for a minute or so more, until fragrant."
- "Add the sausage to the pot and cook until completely browned, breaking it up as you go. Drain any excess grease, if needed."
- "Increase the heat to med-high. Add the carrots to the pot, then stir in the broth, water, diced tomatoes, beans and seasonings."
- "Once it all comes to a boil, stir in the orzo and zuchinni, then lower the heat back down and let simmer for 7-8 minutes, until the veggies have softened and the orzo is close to al dente. Make sure to stir often during this time, so the orzo won&#39;t stick to the pot."
- "Stir in the spinach and simmer just 2-3 minutes more, until it&#39;s wilted."
- "Serve immediately, topped with fresh parmesan cheese, if desired. Sprinkle red pepper flakes over individual portions for a bit of extra heat."
- "Refrigerate any leftovers in a large Tupperware container. To reheat, place the amount you want warmed in a small pot (add a splash of broth if needed, the orzo will absorb a lot of the liquid during frigeration) and bring to a simmer for 5 or so minutes, until heated through."

<i>Before you jump to Italian Orzo Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
