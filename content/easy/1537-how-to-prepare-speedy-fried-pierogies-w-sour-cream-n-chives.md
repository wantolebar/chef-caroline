<i>Before you jump to Fried Pierogies w/ Sour Cream n Chives recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the actual light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. You really need to replace your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Along with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house at the same time. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
