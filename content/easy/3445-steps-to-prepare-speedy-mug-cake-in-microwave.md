<i>Before you jump to Mug cake in microwave recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can easily minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that difficult. It's about being practical, usually.
