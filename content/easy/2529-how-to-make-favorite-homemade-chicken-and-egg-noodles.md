recipeingredient:
- "125 g Flour 1 US cup"
- "4 Egg yolks or 15 to 2 whole eggs"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "2 Tbsp Cold water"
- "250-300 g Chicken thigh is nice 12 to 34 lb"
- "1/4 Onion"
- "1 stalk Celery"
- "1 large carrot"
- " Optional"
- "1 Bay leaf"
- "1 tsp dry thyme or a few fresh sprigs"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, let&#39;s make the noodles! Using just egg yolks gives the riches egg noodle, but as mentioned in the description, you can use 1.5-2 whole eggs instead."
- "Separate the whites from the yolk by carefully cracking the egg and letting the white fall into a bowl (make sure the yolk doesn&#39;t fall in!). *Egg whites can be kept in the fridge for 2 days or freeze well too."
- "In a bowl, mix the flour, egg yolks and salt."
- "It will be a little dry and crumbly, but once the dough starts to hold together, add about 2 Tbsp of water to get the dough just moist enough to knead."
- "Form the dough into a ball and remove to a floured working surface."
- "Knead with the palm of your hand for a few minutes until you get a smooth ball of dough. If it sticks to your hands or the surface, sprinkle more flour."
- "Once the ball of dough is nice and smooth, roll it out as thin as possible. Again, sprinkle with a plenty of flour to prevent sticking."
- "Roll the sheet of dough up like rolling a poster. Slice the dough roll to make the noodles. It can be as thick or thin as you like. Unravel the noodles and cut into smaller size. Dust with flour and let them sit out to dry out."
- "While the noodles are drying, prepare the soup. I used chicken thigh because it stays tender even if boiled, but you can use breast meat."
- "Slice the carrots and celery. Dice the onion. Leave the chicken whole."
- "Add all ingredients except the noodles to a pot and cover with water (I added about 800-900 ml / about 3.5 cups). If using bay leaf and thyme, you can add it here."
- "Bring to a boil on high, then reduce to a low simmer. Skim off any of the foam that arises from boiling the chicken. Let simmer on low for 45-60 min."
- "Remove the chicken from the soup. Pull apart the meat with two forks or with your fingers."
- "Return chicken to the pot and add salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and add the noodles. Stir, turn to low heat and cook covered for another 20-30 minutes until noodles are soft."
- "Adjust taste with salt and pepper. Serve into bowls as is, or if you *really* want to eat it country style, spoon it over mashed potatoes for a carbohydrate fest (lol). Great the next day too!"

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Chicken and Egg Noodles recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Drink water, not alternative drinks. Sipping a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. Using them for your lone source of hydration, however, is dumb. Drinking water instead of other types of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. This also helps you reduce your caloric intake by hundreds of points without needing to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Water is often the key to successful weight loss and healthfulness.

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Remember: being healthy isnâ€™t just about reducing your weight. You want your body to be powerful too.
