<i>Before you jump to Brown sugar bbq chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Start with changing the light bulbs. Accomplish this for your house, not only the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent style, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that hard. It's concerning being sensible, most of the time.
