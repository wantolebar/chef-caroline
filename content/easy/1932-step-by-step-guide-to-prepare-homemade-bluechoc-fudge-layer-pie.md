recipeingredient:
- " base layer"
- "150 g almonds"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "2 tablespoons maple syrup"
- " middle layer"
- "150 g creamed coconut block or coconut butter"
- "2 tablespoons cacao powder"
- "2 tablespoons maple syrup"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- " top layer"
- "50 g creamed coconut or coconut butter"
- "100 g cashew nuts"
- "50 g dates pitted"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1 tablespoon maple syrup"
- "75 g frozen blueberries"
recipeinstructions:
- "In advance: Soak the cashew nuts in water for at least an hour (several hours or even overnight is fine too). Drain them before use (you will use them in the top layer)."
- "Base layer: Use a food processor to grind the almonds down to a meal. It&#39;s fine if this meal is a little rustic with tiny pieces, rather than finely ground."
- "Add the vanilla extract and maple syrup until everything comes together. This mixture should stick together nicely between your fingers when pressed."
- "Line a loaf tin with parchment paper and compact the mixture down very firmly to create a &#39;crust&#39; base layer. Pop it in the fridge whilst you make the next layer."
- "Middle layer: Soften the creamed coconut block (unless it is soft already) by chopping it finely and then placing in a heatproof dish. Place that dish into a pan containing about an inch of water. Heat up the water, which should then gently melt the coconut. When melted, add the cacao, maple syrup and vanilla extract. Mix in thoroughly."
- "Compact this down onto the base layer. Press down with the back of a spoon. If the mixture starts to coagulate then simply press down with the pads of your fingers instead (I always end up doing this with my fingers. The warmth of your hands seems to allow it to be pressed down without coagulating)."
- "Pop it back in the fridge whilst you make the top layer."
- "Top layer: Finely chop the creamed coconut. Pop the chopped coconut, soaked cashew nuts, dates, vanilla and maple syrup into the food processor and blend thoroughly until there are no pieces and everything is evenly combined."
- "Add the frozen blueberries last of all. Blend in the processor and combine thoroughly."
- "Spread the top layer on evenly."
- "Pop it in the fridge for at least an hour, until to top layer firms up (alternative pop it in the freezer if you want it faster)."
- "To serve: Slice and serve. This keeps well for a few days in the fridge or keeps for a couple of months in the freezer."

<i>Before you jump to Bluechoc fudge layer pie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Probably the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. It's related to being sensible, most of the time.
