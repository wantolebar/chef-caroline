<i>Before you jump to Veg soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as economically as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
