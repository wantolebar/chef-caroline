<i>Before you jump to Vegetarian french onion soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as effectively as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
