recipeingredient:
- "6 heaping tbsp chocolate spread  see my free from recipe "
- " OR use melted safe chocolate"
- "210 g glutenfree  plain flour"
- "1 pinch xanthan gum if using glutenfree flour"
- "4 tbsp sugar"
- "3 tsp baking powder"
- "330 ml light coconut milk"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 tbsp oil plus extra for the pan"
recipeinstructions:
- "The first thing you need to do is drop the tablespoons of chocolate spread onto a sheet of baking paper and spread into even discs"
- "Freeze overnight until firm"
- "When ready, mix the rest of the ingredients together briefly until the flour is just incorporated. Don&#39;t overmix or you&#39;ll end up with rubbery pancakes, a few lumps in the batter is totally acceptable. Gluten-free flour will need an extra 2 or 3 tablespoons of milk added but the batter should be relatively thick as this is a Scotch (fluffy) Pancake mix"
- "Lightly oil a frying pan and bring the heat to medium, then turn down to medium low. Test a small ladleful of batter to check the heat of the pan"
- "If it burns before you turn it, turn the heat down a bit more. Likewise if its takes more than 2 minutes to brown, turn the heat up a bit"
- "Put a ladleful of batter (around 4 tablespoons) in the pan and add a frozen chocolate spread disc on top"
- "Add another small amount of batter directly on top of the chocolate disc and spread it around quickly to cover it"
- "Once the bubbles appear all around the edge of the pancake, around 2 minutes, have a quick peek to check the pancake is golden underneath then turn it over and cook for a minute or so until golden on the other side"
- "Repeat with the rest of the batter and choccy discs. You&#39;ll probably need to oil the pan after the first 3 pancakes and if you have any chocolate seep out, wipe the pan or it&#39;ll burn onto the next pancake"
- "Serve while still warm. Delicious topped with sliced strawberries and bananas!"
- "A good tip is to take the discs out of the freezer one disc at a time. They&#39;ll thaw in like 30 seconds and you&#39;ll be unable to pick them up then!"
