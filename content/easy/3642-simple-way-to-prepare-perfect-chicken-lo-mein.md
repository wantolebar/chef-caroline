recipeinstructions:
- "Heat up pan with a splash of olive oil? When oil is hot cook the meat, and some soy sauce And chicken stock.when meat is done remove from pan, and leave the juices from the meat in the pan... when cooking the meat also start the spaghetti noodles in a different pot."
- "Set meat aside let rest.add all frozen veggies, some more soy sauce, cook veggies till done, mix Occasionally,"
- "When noodles are done, remove from heat, and let sit in the pot of water till veggies are done. They should get done about the same time."

The oysters sauce is what gives the noodles that brown look so don’t be scared to use a lot of it. I use spaghetti noodles because it’s cheaper than the lo mein and I can never find them kind of noodles in the first place, plus I make a lot, sometimes I will use two bags of stir fry veggies, just depends on how much I want to make and how hungry everyone is."

<i>Before you jump to Chicken lo mein recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle demands. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a chore. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Be sensible when you do your grocery shopping. Making good decisions when buying food means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to cope with a hectic store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You want to get home quickly and eat something great. Fill your cupboards with healthy foods. This way—even if you choose something a little greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still selecting foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also important. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. You need your body to be powerful too.
