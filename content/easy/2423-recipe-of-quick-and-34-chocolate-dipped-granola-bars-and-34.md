<i>Before you jump to &#34; Chocolate Dipped Granola Bars &#34; recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Preserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
