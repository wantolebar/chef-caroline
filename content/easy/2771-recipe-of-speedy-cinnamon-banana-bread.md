They cost a small amount more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to obtain the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area.
