<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s Grilled Citrus Seafood Dinner recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Working out at the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Take the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will decide to be idle and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done every single day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Looking to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about losing weight. You need your body to be strong too.
