<i>Before you jump to Besan coconut halwa/Gram flour coconut pudding recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. As soon as you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
