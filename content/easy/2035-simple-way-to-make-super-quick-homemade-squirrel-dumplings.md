<i>Before you jump to Squirrel Dumplings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's related to being functional, more often than not.
