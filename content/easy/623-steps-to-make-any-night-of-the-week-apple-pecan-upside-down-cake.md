- "Peel and core the apples.  *I didn&#39;t follow what Claire did. She used a melon baller to core out the seeds and stems. I, however, used an apple corer. You of cos, can choose whichever method as desired.*  Slice the apples into halves.  Place them immediately, cut side down on the skillet.  *The apples will oxidize fast, especially on the cored and cut sides. Do it this way will slow down the oxidization.*"

- "In another large bowl, add the remaining butter, light muscovado sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and demerara sugar.  Cream butter until light and fluffy with a hand or stand mixer.  Add in eggs and the remaining 1 TBSP of calvados."

If there is any leftover caramel that is also stuck on the skillet, add a splash of water and turn the heat up to medium."

<i>Before you jump to Apple-Pecan Upside-Down Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

When you go to the grocery store, be sensible about it. Making good decisions when buying food means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with crowded grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You’re going to go home and use what you have in the cupboards. Your house should be stored with healthy foods and ingredients. This makes it simple to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are many things you can go after to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being smart about the selections you make each day is a start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Don't overlook that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You need to make your body as strong it can be.
