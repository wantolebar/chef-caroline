<i>Before you jump to Caramel Vanilla Apple Crunch recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
