recipeingredient:
- "3 large very ripe bananas"
- "2 large eggs"
- "2 tbs granulated sugar"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 tbs unsalted butter  melted"
- "1 cup milk"
- "2 cups allpurpose flour"
- "4 tsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl mash bananas until slightly liquidy. Add eggs, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla. Whisk until thoroughly combined."
- "Add melted butter and stir until just combined, then add milk and stir until well combined with all other wet ingredients."
- "Add flour, baking, powder, and baking soda. Fold into wet ingredients until just combined. You want your batter to be slightly lumpy. Do not over-mix or you&#39;ll have tough pancakes."
- "Let batter rest for 5-10 minutes while you heat a nonstick skillet, iron skillet, or griddle over medium-low heat. When skillet is hot add 1 tsp of butter if desired and let melt (I don&#39;t do this but some people do)."
- "For 6 inch pancakes: Use a 1/3 cup measuring cup to scoop batter out of bowl and pour into hot skillet. Add as many at one time that you can fit without edges touching (my skillet fits one at a time). For &#34;silver dollar&#34; pancakes scoop 2 tbs of batter per pancake into skillet."
- "Cook pancakes on first side until bubbles just begin to come through and edges look slightly dry. Flip and cook 1 minute, or until second side is lightly browned. The trick is to cook pancakes at a low temperature so they cook all the way through without burning."
- "Stack your perfect pancakes on plates and serve with your favorite toppings (I like peanut butter). Can serve 2-8 people depending on how many pancakes you want to give each person. Haha. I was able to get 8, 6 inch pancakes and 2, 4 inch pancakes out of this batch. Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Extra Fluffy Banana Pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, nevertheless it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is commenced. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
