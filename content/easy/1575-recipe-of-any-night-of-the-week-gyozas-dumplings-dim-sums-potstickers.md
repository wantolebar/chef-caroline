- "1 tsp salt"
- " Cornflour for hands and work surface"
- " Cooking"
- "1-2 tbsp vegetable oil"
- "50 ml cold water  optional 1 tsp cornflour"
- "1 tbsp sesame oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sprinkle 1 tsp salt to dehydrate the chopped cabbage and allow to sit for 15 minutes. Squeeze the water from cabbage using clean tea towel then transfer to another bowl."
- "Cut scallions and mushrooms into small pieces then combine with cabbage and ground pork. Add garlic, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, salt, red wine vinegar and black pepper. Mix well with spatula then knead by hand until all combined. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes."
- "Add flour to a bowl and gradually add salted water then sesame oil and mix. Form dough into a ball - it should pick up all the flour off edges of the bowl. Knead the dough for ten minutes then cut dough in half. Roll each half into logs and wrap tightly with cling film. Allow to rest for 30 minutes."
- "Sprinkle cornflour on work surface and cut each log into 12 pieces. Form each piece into ball shape and use rolling pin to flatten centre of wrapper as you rotate it. Use ramekin or cup to cut wrapper. Stack completed wrappers under wet towel."
- "Take a wrapper and place it in the palm of your non-dominant hand. Use roughly a teaspoon of the mixture in centre of each wrapper. I filled about six at a time. Then dip finger into cold water and run 1/4” circle all around the outside edge of an individual wrapper."
- "Fold the wrapper in half over the filling and pinch it in the centre with your fingers. Working from centre out, use thumb and index finger to make 3-4 pleats on each side. Ensure you press the folded pleat tightly against the back part of the wrapper to minimise wrapper thickness and to ensure that there are no openings. Put each completed gyoza on a lightly floured baking tray and cover with wet towel until cooking."
- "To cook, heat the vegetable oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium high heat. When the pan is hot, place the gyoza in clockwise, flat side down around the pan just ensuring they are not touching each other. Cook until bottom of ALL gyozas are golden brown (1-3mins) then add water (and cornflour) and immediately cover with lid and steam for about 3 minutes or until most of water evaporates. Add 1 tbsp sesame oil around the pan and cook uncovered until bottom of ALL gyozas are crisp."
- "Transfer to a plate with dipping sauce. For the dipping sauce, combine soy sauce and red wine vinegar in a small bowl and add freshly chopped ginger. Mix together and enjoy."
- "To freeze gyozas, lay them on baking tray without overlapping and allow to freeze for 1-2 hours. Then transfer to a freezer bag and store for 3-4 weeks."

<i>Before you jump to Gyozas / Dumplings / Dim Sums / Potstickers recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Be sensible when you do your grocery shopping. Making good decisions when buying food means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with crowded grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You’re going to go home and make what you have on hand. Your kitchen should be filled with healthy foods and ingredients. This way—even if you choose something slightly greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still picking foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need to help make your body as strong as possible.
