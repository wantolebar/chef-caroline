recipeinstructions:
- "Marinate chicken in soy sauce and vinegar with the crushed garlic for at least 2 hours or even overnight. The longer the chicken stays in the marinade, the tastier and flavorful it becomes."
- "Heat oil in pan and cook remaining minced garlic until light golden brown. Set aside toasted garlic as toppings later. Remove chicken from the marinade (keep marinade sauce) and pan fry chicken in the same oil as the garlic for about 3-5 minutes per side or until it browns a little. Don&#39;t worry about having to cook chicken through just yet, as you will still let it stew later."
- "Put back marinade sauce from earlier and add water, sugar, peppercorn, and bay leaves. Add optional potatoes and peeled hard-boiled eggs. Let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes. You will know chicken is cooked once it is fork tender is starting to release oil. I like my adobo on the drier side so I let the it simmer until the sauce thickens and mostly evaporated."
- "Serve with white rice topped with toasted garlic and enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Filipino Chicken Adobo recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Drink water, not alternative beverages. Drinking a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. It is, however, a bad idea to only drink soda or coffee. Having water instead of other types of drinks is a good way to aid your body in its health and hydration. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories from your diet— without having to deal with terrible tasting diet food. Water is ordinarily one of the keys to really reducing your weight and leading a healthful lifestyle.

There are a whole lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the selections you make each day is a start. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about slimming down. It’s about making your body as powerful as it can be.
