recipeingredient:
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "2 bell peppers halved and hollowed"
- "1 stick vegan butter I used Earth Balance"
- " salt and pepper"
- "1 tsp fresh rosemary finely chopped"
- "4 slices follow your heart vegan jack"
- "6-8 yukon gold potatoes"
- "4 garlic cloves finely minced"
- "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease bottom of glass baking dish that will snugly fit 4 (halved) bell peppers. I used a glass pie dish because the sides help hold the peppers flat for nice presentation."
- "Wash, peel and cut yukon gold potatoes into quarters. Boil potatoes in salted water until fork pokes through easily. It usually takes about 30 minutes."
- "Drain water and return potatoes to pan. I always save my potato water for making vegan sauces or gravy later."
- "Add butter to small sauce pan and melt on low heat with minced garlic. Simmer butter and garlic for about 1 minute or until garlic is fragrant and just starting to turn golden in color."
- "Add butter to potatoes and mash by your preferred method. I use a hand masher because it is easy to clean. Drizzle 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil over potatoes and fold into mashed potatoes."
- "Lay slices of vegan cheese inside bell peppers. Crumble cheese if you need to in order to make it fit. It will melt into the potatoes when it bakes."
- "Scoop mashed potatoes into bell peppers evenly. Drizzle last tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil all over top of stuffed peppers. Sprinkle fresh chopped rosemary, salt and pepper on tops evenly. Make sure you do not skip this step. The salt helps create a golden crust to the top of the potatoes."
- "Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Cool for at least 5 minutes before eating. Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Gluten Free &amp; Vegan Mashed Potato Stuffed Bell Peppers recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is finished, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesnâ€™t have to be a chore. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Go up the stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Trying to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You want your body to be powerful too.
