Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Start out with replacing the lights. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them rather than incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to acquire the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Obviously this also happens in different rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. It's related to being functional, usually.
