<i>Before you jump to Turkish style chicken kebabs /Eid Mubarak recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a place to start as any. Accomplish this for the whole house, not just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a little bit more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house as well. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
