Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as efficiently as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that tough. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
