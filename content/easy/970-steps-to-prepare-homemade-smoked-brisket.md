<i>Before you jump to Smoked brisket recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can easily minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
