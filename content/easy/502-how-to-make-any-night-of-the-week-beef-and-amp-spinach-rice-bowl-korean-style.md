recipeingredient:
- " Main"
- "1 lb Beef"
- "2 bunch spinach fresh"
- "4 cup cooked rice"
- " Sauce"
- "4 clove garlic"
- "3 tbsp hot sauce or gochujang"
- "1 tbsp soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp sugar"
- "3 tbsp water"
- "2 tsp roasted sesame seeds optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the beef cross grain in strips, for this one I had a streak I bought it on sale. I cut it in thirds, then cross cut those for 2 inch x 1 inch x 1/8 inch strips."
- "Season the streak strips with salt and pepper, I would be light on the salt, this seems to have enough."
- "Mix all sauce ingredients, except for garlic"
- "Heat about 1 tablespoon (med to med-high) oil in a pan, add chopped garlic, cook for about 1 minute"
- "Add sauce to pan, allow to boil and thicken a little."
- "Remove sauce from heat, set aside"
- "Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet, same heat as sauce, add beef to oil, stir fry until desired doneness."
- "Remove beef to a plate when done"
- "Add spinach to beef pan, with beef drippings, same heat"
- "Cook until well wilted, keep flipping, I used tongs."
- "Add rice to spinach, turn heat down to med, stir to combine, it is easier to do this before adding the rest."
- "Add beef back in, add about half the sauce. Combine well."
- "Taste, add more sauce until you like it. Serve, sprinkle sesame seeds, sliced green onions"
- "NOTES - I would imagine frozen spinach could also be used, but I have not done that. If you use a thin hot sauce instead of say gochujang paste, add a teaspoon of flour to the water for the sauce to help it thicken. A medium grain rice I think works best for this, but long grain and brown is fine also."
