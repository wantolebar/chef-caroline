recipeingredient:
- "350 g 12 oz 2 cups plain flour"
- "125 g 4 oz  cup butter"
- "125 ml 4 fl oz  cup Golden Syrup or light molasses"
- "100 g 3 oz  cup sugar"
- "1 egg"
- "2 tsp ground ginger powder"
- "1 tsp cinnamon"
- "1 tsp baking soda"
- "1/4 tsp ground cloves"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "150 g 5 oz 1 cup of icing or Confectioners sugar"
- " About 1 tbsp of milk or water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Beat together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in the egg and Golden Syrup until the mixture is smooth.  Sift in the remainder of the ingredients and beat/mix to form a smooth dough."
- "Wrap the dough in plastic or place in a plastic bag. Let the dough chill in the ‘fridge for about an hour to firm up. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to about ¼” (6mm) thick.   Use a gingerbread man cutter to cut out the shapes. Place a piece of baking paper on a baking tray and arrange the shapes ready for baking. Leave at least ½” (1cm) between the shapes."
- "Bake at 180°C (350°F) for 10 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool before decorating. Prepare the frosting: Sift the icing sugar into a bowl and gradually mix in the milk until you achieve a firm paste. Use a piping bag or syringe to decorate the shapes."
- "#Tips:  The initial dough should be quite firm – if it is too soft it will spread while cooking. If you find your dough is very soft simply sift in a tbsp or two of extra flour until you achieve the desired consistency.  While gingerbread men are traditional, you can make other shapes too depending upon what cookie-cutter shapes you have."
- "If you want to use different colours in decorating the shapes, simply take a portion of the frosting and mix in a drop or two of food colouring. You can also decorate with Smarties for buttons."

<i>Before you jump to 🍪Gingerbread Men🍪 recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.

Take the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about losing weight. You want your body to be strong too.
