<i>Before you jump to Vickys Plain Scones, Gluten, Dairy, Egg &amp; Soy-Free recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
