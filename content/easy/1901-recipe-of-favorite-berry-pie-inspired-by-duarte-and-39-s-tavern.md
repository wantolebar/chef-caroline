- " butter"
- " salt"
- " whole milk"
- " olallieberries or any locally available berry"
- " sugar give or take"
- " flour"
- " lemon"
- " vanilla paste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven to 375F."
- "Dice up the butter. It should be cold from the fridge. Combine with flour and salt in a bowl."
- "Cut the butter into the flour. Use a pastry blender, or a fork if one is not available."
- "Add milk. Stir to a soft, malleable dough."
- "Divide dough in half. Roll one out to accommodate your pie dish (9-10 inches maybe). You&#39;ll need a little dusting of flour. The dough is quite sticky."
- "Line your pie dish with dough. This can be tricky. Keep at it. Dustings of flour will minimize sticking. If it tears, just squish it back together. It doesn&#39;t need to be perfect. Note: This recipe fits a classic pie tin. I used this fancy new ceramic one, and it was actually just way too big. For my second try I used a cake pan. Worked alright aside from being difficult to serve."
- "Combine the remaining ingredients. Mix them up and give a taste because you may want to adjust the sugar depending on the ripeness of the berries. Pour this filling into the pie dough. Note: If you&#39;re using frozen berries, be sure to defrost them first or your pie will be very wet."
- "Roll out the other dough half, just a bit smaller, and lay it over the top of your pie. Press the edges gently to seal. Slice a couple holes in the top for the steam. Trim up the edges with a sharp knife."
- "Line a baking sheet with foil and put that on the bottom rack of your oven. This will catch any drippings and avoid a major cleanup session. Place the pie on the top rack over the foiled pan. Bake for about 1 hour."

<i>Before you jump to Berry Pie (Inspired by Duarte&#39;s Tavern) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Walk up the stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about losing weight. You really want your body to be powerful too.
