- " Pepper and chili powder optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the bread flour, salt, sugar, and yeast in a big mixing bowl. Add in the warm water and oil."
- "Mix it with spatula. When the liquid is gone and the mixture is crumbly, combine them with hand until it forms a dough. Knead it for 10 mins. Shape into a round ball and cover the bowl with cling wrap or damp cloth. Let it rise for 1 hour or until it double. (NOTE: you can use stand mixer for this step if you don’t want to knead it by hand)"
- "Poke the dough with your index finger; if the hole doesn’t close by itself, it is done. Pick it up and knead it gently, shape it into a ball. Put it back into the mixing bowl and cover the bowl with cling wrap or damp cloth. Let it rise for 10-20 mins."
- "Spread oil from the canned tuna onto the pan you are using (i used my pie tin for this as i do not own a pizza pan). Put the dough onto it, oil the dough a little bit, and spread it with your fingers. Try to spread it evenly. I make the edges (1/2 inch) a little bit thicker than the middle."
- "Poke the middle with fork evenly. Bake it for 5 mins in a 220 C oven (I did this since i like crispy pizza, but you can just bake it altogether later on with the toppings intact)."
- "Pull it out of the oven, spread tomato ketchup and hot sauce onto the pizza. Sprinkle with some italian seasonings."
- "Mix the strained tuna flakes with mayonnaise, just until it is nice and moist (like salad). Spread it evenly onto the pizza. Spread the corn kernels and sliced onion too. Add a last zig-zag of mayo onto the pizza (if you like mayo like i do), and sprinkle with pepper and chili powder (additional). Finally, top it off with generous sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese."
- "Bake it in the oven (220 C) for about 10 mins or until golden. Cut it in 6 or 8 pieces, serve it while it’s still hot!"

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Tuna Mayo Pizza recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Perhaps the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, after all. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
