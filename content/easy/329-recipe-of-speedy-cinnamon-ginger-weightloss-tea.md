<i>Before you jump to Cinnamon ginger (weightloss tea) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as economically as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
