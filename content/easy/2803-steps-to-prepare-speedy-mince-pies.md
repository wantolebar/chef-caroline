- "1 large orange zested peeled and diced"
- "1 cup raisins 12 cup golden raisin"
- "1/2 cup dried apricots chopped"
- "1/3 cup dark brown sugar 14 cup lemon juice"

- " Sweet shortcrust pastry dough"
- "225 g cold butter diced 350g plain flour"
- "100 g sugar 280g mincemeat"
- "1 egg icing sugar to dust"
recipeinstructions:
- "#Sweet #fruit #mincemeat  In a medium saucepan, mix diced apples, orange zest, diced orange fruit, and remaining ingredients except the orange juice. Stir and simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally for 30 minutes. Remove the mixture from the heat and stir.Place the mixture in an air-tight container and store in the refrigerator for at least 2 weeks before using, to let the flavors meld. This will keep in the fridge 2-3 months. (You also bought it from the shop)"
- "#Sweet #shortcrust #pastry #dough  To make the pastry, rub 225g cold, diced butter into 350g plain flour, then mix in 100g golden caster sugar and a pinch of salt. Combine the pastry into a ball – don’t add liquid – and knead it briefly. The dough will be fairly firm, like shortbread dough. You can use the dough immediately, or chill for later.  (You also bought it from the shop)"
- "#How_to_Baked_Mince_Pies  Preheat the oven to 200C/gas 6/fan 180C. Line 18 holes of two 12-hole patty tins or muffin tins, by pressing small walnut-sized balls of pastry into each hole. Spoon 280g mincemeat into the pies."
- "Take slightly smaller balls of pastry than before and pat them out between your hands to make round lids, big enough to cover the pies. Top the pies with their lids, pressing the edges gently together to seal – you don’t need to seal them with milk or egg as they will stick on their own. If you like your pie star top use star cookie cutter (The pies may now be frozen for up to 1 month)."
- "Beat 1 small egg and brush the tops of the pies. Bake for 20 minutes until golden. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack. To serve, lightly dust with icing sugar. They will keep for 3 to 4 days in an airtight container."

<i>Before you jump to ❄🎄⛄🌲🍥Mince pies 🍥🌲⛄🎄❄ recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Start with exchanging the light bulbs. Complete this for your house, not just the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent type, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a little bit more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
