<i>Before you jump to Vegetable Stir Fry&#39;s recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is definitely not true. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
