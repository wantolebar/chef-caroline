recipeingredient:
- "1 packages egg roll wrappers can use wonton wrappers for smaller rolls"
- "1 jar Nutella chocolate spread"
- "1 cup chopped hazelnuts  can use any nut you like"
- "1 powdered sugar to sprinkle on top optional"
- "1 oil for deep frying or deep skillet to pan fry"
- "1 water to seal edges"
recipeinstructions:
- "Take egg roll or wonton wrapper and place in a diamond shape."
- "Take 2 tablespoons of the hazelnut spread and place across middle of wrapper leaving room on the sides to roll. Use less if using wonton wrappers since they are smaller."
- "Sprinkle some of the chopped nuts onto the chocolate spread. I use a food processor to finely chop my hazelnuts, but chopped is fine also."
- "Take the corner closest to you and fold over just past the chocolate and nuts."
- "Fold over each side to meet in the middle to seal and hold mixture inside wrapper. Like a burrito."
- "Making sure edges are secure, continue tightly rolling towards the top of the wrapper."
- "When almost to the top, leave a edge and dip your fingers in the water and dab around the edge of  the top on inside edge."
- "Continue to roll to seal the wrapper. The water will act as a glue to hold roll together."
- "Heat the oil to 375 while preparing the rolls. When oil is heated, cook a few at a time. This does not take long to brown. Just a few minutes. If pan frying, place sealed flap down in pan first to keep sealed. Do not over crowd."
- "Flip over if pan frying when golden brown on both sides. If deep frying, it should brown all at once, you may have to flip if needed. Do not over crowd, just cook a few at a time not to over crowd."
- "When golden brown, remove from oil and drain on paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Can use baking rack also."
- "Sprinkle with confectioners sugar while hot or after cooled, this step is optional. I just like it."
- "I took picture of both egg roll and wonton rolls to show the size difference. Bite size or full size, both are great!"

<i>Before you jump to Chocolate Hazelnut Dessert Egg rolls recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle involves. When our work day is complete, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Consider the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done each day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the choices you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthy isnâ€™t just about losing weight. You really want your body to be strong too.
