<i>Before you jump to Smarties Cookies 🍪 (aka M&amp;M cookies) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. A lot of it truly is basically making use of common sense.
