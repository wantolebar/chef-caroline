The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

You may prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. As soon as you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong.
