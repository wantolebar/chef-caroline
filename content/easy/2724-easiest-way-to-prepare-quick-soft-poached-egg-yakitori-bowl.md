A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently.

The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.
