<i>Before you jump to Pav Bhaji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, after all. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
