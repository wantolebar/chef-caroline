Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
