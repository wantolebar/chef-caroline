<i>Before you jump to Watermelon&#39;s shell Ragout with fish and shrimps recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Consider the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Looking to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. You need your body to be powerful too.
