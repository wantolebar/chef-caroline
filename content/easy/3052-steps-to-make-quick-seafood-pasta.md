Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements.

Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as effectively as they should.

Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less frequently, will also save electricity.
