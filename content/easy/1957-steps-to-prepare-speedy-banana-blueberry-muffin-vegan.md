<i>Before you jump to Banana Blueberry Muffin (Vegan) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Let's begin with something not that hard, changing the actual light bulbs. Accomplish this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house also. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
