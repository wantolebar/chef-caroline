<i>Before you jump to Cho Gochujang (Korean Seasoned Red Chili Paste with Vinegar) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Take the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't forget that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It’s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
