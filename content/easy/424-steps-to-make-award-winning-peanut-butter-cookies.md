It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, after all. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
