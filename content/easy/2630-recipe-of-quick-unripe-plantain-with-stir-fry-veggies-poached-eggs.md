<i>Before you jump to Unripe plantain with stir fry veggies poached eggs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. A lot of it is basically utilizing common sense.
