<i>Before you jump to chicken chowder recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is going. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. It's concerning being sensible, most of the time.
