<i>Before you jump to LuBella&#39;s Pizza Dough recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good a spot to begin with as any. Complete this for the entire house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them rather than incandescent lights. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Using these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently come across members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
