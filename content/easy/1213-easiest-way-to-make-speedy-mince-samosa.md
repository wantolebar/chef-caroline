<i>Before you jump to Mince Samosa recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

The kitchen alone gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
