recipeingredient:
- " sliced medium yellow potatoes"
- " cream"
- " salt"
- " ground black pepper"
- " garlic"
- " comte cheese"
- " smoked paprika"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice your potatoes on a mandolin. They should be a little thicker than a quarter."
- "Add cream, salt, and pepper. With a microplane, peel and grate the garlic clove into the bowl. Mix well."
- "In a small casserole dish, arrange the potato slices neatly to form a layer. Pour in a little bit of cream, just enough to coat the potatoes. Grate some of the cheese over the layer as well. Repeat until you&#39;ve used up all of the potatoes. On the top layer, add a sprinkling of paprika. NOTE: I used an 8.5&#34;x 5.5&#34; casserole dish. If you use a larger dish, you can either double the recipe or bake for less time."
- "Cover in foil and bake for 30 minutes."
- "Remove foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes."
- "At this point, you should be getting close, but you may need to bake a little longer. The dish is ready when the cream has reduced so that it can not be seen sloshing around in the dish, and there are only intermittent bubbles. You should have a nice bit of golden crust as you see in the main photo."

<i>Before you jump to Really Good Scalloped Potatoes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Make smart choices when grocery shopping. If you make smart choices when you are purchasing your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with jampacked grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to go to your apartment and make something from your kitchen. Make sure that what you have on hand is healthful. In this way, even when you decide that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are a good deal of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. It is more about making your body as powerful as it can be.
