<i>Before you jump to Greek Pasta Salad (Version 2) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. It's about being functional, usually.
