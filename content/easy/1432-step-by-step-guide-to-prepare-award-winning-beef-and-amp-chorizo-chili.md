- "NOTE: If you feel nervous about smashing up the tomatoes in the pot (like you could burn yourself, which you shouldn&#39;t because you shouldn&#39;t be submerging your hand into anything) smash them up in a separate bowl before adding. I just do them directly in the pot to save a dish. It is wise, though, to utilize your pot lid as a shield to prevent squinting everything with tomato juice and seeds. Lol"
- "NOTE 2: If you can&#39;t find El Pato brand hot tomato sauce in your local market any brand of hot tomato sauce will do (you just need a small can). We just really think El Pato is the best."
- "NOTE 3: For a tasty homemade chili seasoning see the recipe for &#34;chilly chili seasoning&#39; on my page."

<i>Before you jump to Beef &amp; Chorizo Chili recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthful.

When you go to the grocery store, be smart about it. When you make informed and wise purchases at the grocery store, your meals will get much healthier automatically. At the end of your day do you really want to deal with crowded grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to go to your house and make something from your kitchen. Your kitchen should be filled with healthy foods and ingredients. This makes it simple to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is naturally better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every single day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. You really want your body to be strong too.
