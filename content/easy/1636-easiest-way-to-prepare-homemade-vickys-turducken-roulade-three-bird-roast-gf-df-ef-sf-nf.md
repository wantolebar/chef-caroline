recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to gas 6 / 200C / 400°F"
- "First butterfly the turkey and duck breasts. This just means cut through one side almost to the other side so you can then open the breast out like a book or a pair of butterfly wings"
- "The poultry pieces all need to be the same thickness, so place them each between 2 sheets of parchment paper or cling wrap and lightly pound them with a rolling pin so they are all around half an inch thick all over but evenly shaped"
- "Clear your workspace and lay a sheet of cling wrap down. Place lengths of butchers twine on top, down every couple of inches from top to bottom. Place the butterflied turkey breast skin side down on top of this"
- "Rub the turkey with a little olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper. Cover with a layer of stuffing keeping a border about 2 inches back from the edges. Pack it down a little, again around the same thickness as the turkey  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/350505-vickys-cornbread-stuffing-gluten-dairy-egg-soy-free"
- "Now lay the butterflied duck breast on top and again, oil, season and cover with stuffing"
- "Place the chicken thigh on top of that and oil and season it"
- "Now using the cling wrap to help you, tightly roll the turkey over the duck and chicken jelly/swiss roll style, overlapping the bottom slightly to make a cylindrical kind of sausage shape"
- "Gently start removing the cling wrap and tying the butchers twine around the &#39;sausage&#39; to secure it so it doesn&#39;t spread open in the oven"
- "Place in a small oven tray, seam down, rub some butter or sunflower spread over the chicken skin and season lightly with more salt and black pepper. Add the chicken stock to the bottom of the tray. This will help replace the juices in the meat that the stuffing soaks up and give you a base for your gravy"
- "Cover the tray tightly with foil and roast for 90 minutes"
- "Remove the foil, baste with the juices and return to the oven to colour for a further 30 minutes. If you like the skin darker and crisper leave it a little longer"
- "Remove from oven tray and let stand for 15 - 20 minutes wrapped with foil to seal in the juices, then snip off the butchers twine and slice into thick slices"
- "Serve with roast potatoes, carrots, sprouts, cocktail sausages wrapped in bacon, extra stuffing, chicken gravy and cranberry sauce"

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
