<i>Before you jump to Caramel Pudding recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that hard. Largely, all it requires is a little common sense.
