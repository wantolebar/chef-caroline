You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, usually.
