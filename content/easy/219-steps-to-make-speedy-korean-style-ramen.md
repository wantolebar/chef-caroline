It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to operate as often.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. It's about being functional, most of the time.
