<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that tough. It's about being practical, more often than not.
