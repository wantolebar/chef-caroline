Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around.

Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Start out with changing the light bulbs. Do this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. You need to upgrade your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more originally, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. You also have to acquire the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and see how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. It's about being practical, usually.
