<i>Before you jump to Vodka Caramel Apple Cider recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Begin with replacing the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. You really need to upgrade your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than just swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Certainly this also happens in different rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being practical, most of the time.
