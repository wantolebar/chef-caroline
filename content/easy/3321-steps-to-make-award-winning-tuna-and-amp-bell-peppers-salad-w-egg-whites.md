<i>Before you jump to Tuna &amp; Bell Peppers Salad w/ Egg Whites recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is as good a spot to begin with as any. This will certainly go outside of the kitchen, but that is okay. You need to upgrade your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll usually discover members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
