Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is going. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen alone gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
