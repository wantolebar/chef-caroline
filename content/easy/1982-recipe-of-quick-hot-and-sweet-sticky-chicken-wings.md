<i>Before you jump to Hot and Sweet Sticky Chicken Wings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that difficult. It's concerning being practical, more often than not.
