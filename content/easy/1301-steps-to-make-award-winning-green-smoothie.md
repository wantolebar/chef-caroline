<i>Before you jump to Green Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Maybe the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. As soon as you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
