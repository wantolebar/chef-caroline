Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is going. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. A lot of it truly is simply utilizing common sense.
