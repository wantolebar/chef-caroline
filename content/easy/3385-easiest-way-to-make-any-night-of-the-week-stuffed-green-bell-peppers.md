recipeingredient:
- "2 lb ground beef"
- "3 large chopped zucchini"
- "1 cup grated carrot"
- "1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper"
- "1 cup finely chopped sweet yellow onion"
- "4 clove garlic finely chopped or pressed"
- "6 oz can of tomato sauce of any kind I used El Pato which is a spicier red sauce you can find in the hispanic food section of your grocery store"
- "1 1/2 cup Minute White rice"
- "1 1/2 cup water"
- "2 tsp tomato chicken bouillon"
- "1 tbsp of tomato paste"
- "1/2 tsp ground black pepper"
- "1 cup shredded cheese of any kind I used monterey jack but cheddar is amazing as well"
- "4 large green bell peppers cut in half and cleaned out"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large microwavable container, add rice, warm water, bouillon, tomato paste and pepper. Make sure paste is well incorporated into the rice mixture. It helps if your water is warm, then you can dissolve your bouillon and paste before adding to rice. Once mixed, place in microwave with lid slightly covering but not closed and microwave for about 5 mins. Let rice sit for another 5 mins or until liquid is dissolved and rice is tender to fluff with a fork."
- "Set aside rice mixture with lid on to stay warm and in a Large Pan, add about a tbs of olive oil and start cooking down onion, garlic, carrots, red bell pepper and zucchini. Cook on about Medium temperature until vegetables are tender but not over cooked. You want them to keep their shape when incorporating all ingredients. Remove from pan &amp; set aside."
- "In the same pan, start cooking your ground beef until well browned. Approximately 5mins. Drain all fat from beef with a spoon. Adjust your temperature to med low and add your cooked vegetables and the can of tomato sauce. Fold in all ingredients and simmer on low for about 5 mins more."
- "Turn off stove and allow mixture to cool down. Taking your green bell peppers, cut in half so they create little cups and can stand up on their own on the pan. Remove core, stems and all seeds. Using any large baking dish, cover entire bottom in foil to eliminate messy cleanup. Place all pepper halves on bottom about 1/2 inch away from each other"
- "Preheat oven to 375°F"
- "Take beef and vegetable mixture and in a large bowl mix into rice. Fold ingredients together as to not mush up rice or break down vegetables. This is the seasoning stage. Adjust flavors to your preferences by adding more salt or herbs if you choosing. Once everything is mixed well, start filling pepper halves by pushing down rice/meat mixture until they are fully filled. You may have extra filling which is always yummy on it&#39;s own. :)"
- "Once all pepper halves are completed, pile on shredded cheese. Cover entire pan and peppers with foil trying not to touch tops of peppers. Make sure there is a slit on the top for steam. Place in oven and cook for about 30 mins. During the last 5 mins, remove foil and allow cheese to brown."
- "I serve these on their own with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese. You can change up the recipe and add mushrooms if desired or even substitute white rice for brown. I made a low carb version without rice and used 3lbs of ground beef and a pound of lean sausage instead. The possibilities are endless. I hope you enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Stuffed Green Bell Peppers recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as economically as they should. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
