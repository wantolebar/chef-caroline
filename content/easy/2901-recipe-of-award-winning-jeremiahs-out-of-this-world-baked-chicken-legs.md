<i>Before you jump to Jeremiah’s Out-of-this-World Baked Chicken Legs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, all things considered. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
