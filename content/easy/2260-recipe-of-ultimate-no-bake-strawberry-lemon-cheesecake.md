recipeingredient:
- " For the crust"
- "10-12 digestive cookies or graham cracker"
- "1 tbsp granulated sugar"
- "5 tbsp melted butter"
- " For cheesecake filling"
- "1/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 pack Philadelphia cream cheese at room temperature"

- "3 tbsp lemon juice"
- " Zest of 1 lemon"
- "4 grams powdered gelatin"
- "2 tbsp boiling hot water"
- " Topping"
- " Lots of strawberries"
- " Or whatever fruit you fancy  "
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the crackers into a ziplock bag and crush them into crumbs. Add melted butter and granulated sugar. The consistency should be like wet sand."
- "Line the pan of your choice with parchment paper, and pour the cracker crumbs into it, press down tightly with a spoon to form the base for the crust. Set aside."
- "In a bowl, beat the whipping cream until it can stand alone (until it is like whipped cream texture). Be careful not to overwhip, because the cream will start to separate into fats and whey. Set the whipped cream aside."
- "In a separate bowl, beat the granulated sugar with the cream cheese until well combined. Add in lemon juice and lemon zest."
- "Mix together the powdered gelatin with the hot water until it is well dissolved (make sure there are no lumps), and pour into the cream cheese mixture. Mix well."
- "Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Make sure to gently mix, otherwise the cake will not be light and airy. Once well mixed, pour into the pan that holds the already made crust."
- "Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or over night. Then slice up some strawberries or fruits of your choice and decorate the top! Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to NO BAKE Strawberry Lemon Cheesecake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Go up the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. It’s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
