<i>Before you jump to Dahi bhale recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Let's begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. Complete this for the whole house, not just the kitchen. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more initially, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The family spends a lot of time in the cooking area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
