You also have to acquire the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area.

And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and discover exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
