Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen area. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent style, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. Along with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This likewise happens in the rest of the house, but we are trying to save money in the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
