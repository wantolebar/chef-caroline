<i>Before you jump to Stuffed Shells recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. It's about being practical, usually.
