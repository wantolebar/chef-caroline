recipeingredient:
- "3 Egg whites"
- "90 grams Granulated sugar"
- "90 grams Powdered sugar"
- "12 grams Cornstarch"
- "200 ml Heavy cream"
- " Sugar"
- "1 dash Vanilla extract"
- " Fruits of your choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the powdered sugar and the cornstarch."
- "Add the granulated sugar to the egg whites."
- "Mix the egg whites as if cutting through them."
- "Whisk at a high speed with an electric hand mixer to make stiff foam. Bring out the sticky texture of the egg whites by beating for about 10 minutes."
- "Sift in the combined powder from Step 1 in 3 batches. Mix roughly with a rubber spatula after adding the powder each time. To avoid breaking the foam, do not press the foam with the flat side of the spatula while mixing."
- "Slide the spatula into the foam horizontally, scoop some of the foam, flip over the spatula towards you, and let the foam fall. Keep rotating the bowl during this step."
- "Pipe the meringue in circles on the baking sheet lined with the parchment paper, (or scoop the meringue with a spoon and spread out into a circle)."
- "Attach a star shaped nozzle and make a wall by piping dots at the edge. If you make a double-layered wall, it will be firmer, (or make a wall roughly with a spoon)."
- "If you have time, leave the meringue base for 20 to 30 minutes to let the surface dry. It makes the result look better. To let dry quickly, I recommend you to put it in front of a heater."
- "Pipe the extra meringue into small circles and bake with the meringue base. It is good for a small snack. Crushed almonds or walnuts are good to mix with meringue for a delicious flavor."
- "Bake at 120 ℃ for 30 to 40 minutes. Turn around the baking sheet every 10 minutes while baking. When baked, let cool for a while, then place on a rack and let cool again."
- "If you have time, it is recommended not to open the oven soon after baking to let dry in residual heat. (You can leave it overnight if you bake at night.)"
- "Add the sugar and the vanilla extract to the heavy cream and whip. Pipe the whipped cream on the meringue base, and decorate the fruits. It&#39;s done."
- "The small meringues are crispy and tasty. The baking time is a little shorter than that for the pavlova, so please check the color and remove from the oven when baked."

<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
