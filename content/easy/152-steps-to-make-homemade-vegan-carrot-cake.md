<i>Before you jump to Vegan carrot cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, of course. It's about being sensible, usually.
