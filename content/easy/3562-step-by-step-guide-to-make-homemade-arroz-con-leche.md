<i>Before you jump to Arroz Con Leche recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Start with changing the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen area. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll usually discover members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. It's related to being sensible, usually.
