recipeinstructions:
- "In a big mixing bowl combine whole wheat flour, all purpose flour, salt and powdered sugar and mix well. Now make a small depression (round) in the centre and pour warm water in it. Add granulated sugar and yeast to it. Leave it for 5 minutes. Now add the oil and vanilla extract to the yeast and make a slurry."
- "Now using your hands mix the yeast with the flour mixture and knead a dough. Transfer the dough on a lightly floured work surface and knead for 4-5 minutes until the dough becomes soft and smooth. Then make a round ball of the dough. Put the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover it with a cloth and let it rise for about 1- 1.5 hours or until it has almost doubled in volume."
- "Meanwhile prepare the filling. Combine all the ingredients listed in filling section(except cinnamon powder and walnuts) in a microwave safe bowl and microwave on medium-high for one minute and then take it out and using a whisk mix well. Microwave again for a minute, take it out and mix well."
- "Let the chocolate sauce cool and then keep it refrigerated until required. When the dough has doubled in volume knock it down with a fist and on a floured surface roll it into a rectangle with 1/2 cm thickness."
- "Now spread half of the chocolate mixture and spread evenly on the rolled dough leaving 1&#34; border on each side. Sprinkle cinnamon powder evenly over the chocolate spread followed by chopped walnuts. Roll the dough into a tight log."
- "Take a sharp knife and cut the log lengthwise. Then twist each piece and make an X as a braid. Then seal each end properly by pinching it under the braid. Lift the log gently and carefully and put it into a lined 9&#34; loaf pan and cover it with a samp cloth and keep it in a warm place to let rise until it doubles in volume."
- "Preheat the oven at 180°c. Brush the loaf with almond milk. Bake for about 30-40 minutes or until the bread gets a beautiful golden brown colour. Take it out and let it cool. Meanwhile prepare the sugar syrup. For the syrup boil sugar and water in a sauce pan until the sugar dissolves completely. Brush the Babka with this syrup generously or pour a little at a time all over the bread and let it cool."
- "Slice it and drizzle some chocolate sauce over it and serve warm. Notes : Always serve the bread warm. Don&#39;t skip the sugar syrup it keeps the bread soft and moist. Babka can be stored in the refrigerator wrapped in a foil up to 4 days. You can even make sweet French toasts using Babka. It tastes amazing. You can try different nuts and fruits as a filling."

<i>Before you jump to Chocolate Babka bread (vegan) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Drink water, not alternative beverages. Soda and coffee, when ingested in small amounts, aren't that bad. It is definitely, however, a bad idea to only drink soda or coffee. Ingesting water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories out of your diet— without having to be forced to eat terrible tasting diet food. Productive weight loss efforts often depend entirely on water intake.

There are a lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
