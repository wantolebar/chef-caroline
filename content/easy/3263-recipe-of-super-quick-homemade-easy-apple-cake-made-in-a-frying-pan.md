<i>Before you jump to Easy Apple Cake Made In a Frying Pan recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the particular light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. You need to upgrade your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Obviously this also happens in different rooms, not just the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that tough. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
