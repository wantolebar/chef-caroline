- "2 tsp vanilla preferably mexican"
- "1 cup boiling water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350° and spray a 9in×13in or two 9in pans. If you do not having cooking spray, you can butter your pans and lightly flour them."
- "Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt to a large bowl (or a mixer bowl). Whisk all ingredients together or using your paddle attachment stir until well combined."
- "Now add the milk, vegetable oil, eggs and vanilla. On medium speed mix all ingredients together until well combined."
- "Now reduce speed add the instant coffee to the boiling water and stir well. Slowly add the coffee mixture to the bowl with the batter. Once all has been added turn the speed up a notch (medium) to make sure all is combined thoroughly. *Note: The batter will be more &#34;liquid-y&#34; then store bought batter but trust me, it bakes into a moist wonderful cake full of flavor."
- "Pour the batter into your pan or pans (divide equally) and bake for 30 minutes or until inserting a toothpick in the center comes out clean."
- "Now frost with your favorite frosting. I personally love a white vanilla butter frosting to go along with this. If you haven&#39;t tried it, please do so. It is to die for! I have posted it as The Best Vanilla Butter Frosting You&#39;ve Ever Had."

<i>Before you jump to Best Chocolate Cake Ever-Trust Me! recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Be wise when you do your food shopping. If you make smart decisions when you are purchasing your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to deal with a chaotic store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You want to get home immediately and eat something good. Make sure that what you already have is healthy. This makes it simple to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is naturally better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Trying to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about slimming down. It is more about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
