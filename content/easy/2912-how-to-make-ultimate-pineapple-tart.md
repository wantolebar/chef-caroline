<i>Before you jump to Pineapple Tart recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as economically as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it truly is merely making use of common sense.
