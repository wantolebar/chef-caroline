<i>Before you jump to Stuffed bell peppers recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. It's about being functional, most of the time.
