<i>Before you jump to Spicy Korean BBQ Pork recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Let's begin with something really easy, changing the actual light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than merely exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not just the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it truly is simply making use of common sense.
