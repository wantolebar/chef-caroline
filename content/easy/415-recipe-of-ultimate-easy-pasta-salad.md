Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

You may possibly prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money.

When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many men and women wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle.
