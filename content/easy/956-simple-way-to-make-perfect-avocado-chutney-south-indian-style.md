<i>Before you jump to Avocado Chutney (South Indian Style) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Don't ignore that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You need your body to be strong too.
