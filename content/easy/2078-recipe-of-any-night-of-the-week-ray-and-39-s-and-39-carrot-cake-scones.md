That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it.

Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as effectively as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.
