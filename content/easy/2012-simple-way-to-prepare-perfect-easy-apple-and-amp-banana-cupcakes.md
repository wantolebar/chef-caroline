<i>Before you jump to easy apple &amp; banana cupcakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of electrical power is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. It's about being sensible, more often than not.
