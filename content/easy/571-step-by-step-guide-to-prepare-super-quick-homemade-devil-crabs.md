<i>Before you jump to Devil crabs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty straightforward to live green, after all. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
