<i>Before you jump to German pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that tough. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
