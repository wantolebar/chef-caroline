recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Spaghetti"
- "2 slice Bacon or thinly sliced pork belly"
- "1/4 bag Shimeji mushrooms or any mushrooms of your choice"
- "1  Egg"
- "3 tbsp  Parmesan cheese grated"
- "1 dash Salt"
- "1 dash Coarsely ground black pepper"
- "2 to 5 tablespoons Pasta cooking water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the spaghetti in plenty of 1% salt water. (Drain the pasta a bit earlier than the cooking time indicated on the package, so it&#39;s al dente.)"
- "Cut up the additional ingredients. Make the ★ egg mixture. Beat the egg with a whisk until it&#39;s creamy, and mix in the Parmesan cheese."
- "Cook the bacon in a frying pan until it&#39;s crispy. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water. Add the mushrooms and any other vegetables, and sauté them."
- "Put the cooked spaghetti in the frying pan and mix well with the other ingredients. If there is not enough pasta water, add 1 to 2 more tablespoons."
- "Take the frying pan off the heat, add the egg mixture and toss quickly so that the egg doesn&#39;t set. Keep putting the frying pan on and off the heat (set to low) until the egg is creamy."
- "Taste, and see if the seasoning is just right. Transfer to a plate, add some coarsely ground black pepper to taste, and enjoy."
- "Here I used pork belly. If you&#39;re using pork belly instead of bacon, you should salt it beforehand. Pork belly will increase the calorie count a bit."
- "With these ingredients, 1 serving has 709 kcal. If you just use mushrooms (and no pork belly or bacon), it has about 547 kcal."

<i>Before you jump to No Oil or Cream Added! Whole Egg Spaghetti Carbonara recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is finished, most people do not wish to go to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Drink water, not alternative beverages. Soda and coffee, when used in small amounts, aren't that bad. Using them for your lone source of hydration, on the other hand, is dumb. Drinking water instead of other kinds of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. This also helps you lower your caloric intake by hundreds of points without needing to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Water is usually one of the keys to really slimming down and leading a healthful lifestyle.

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being clever when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about reducing your weight. It is more about making your body as strong as it can be.
