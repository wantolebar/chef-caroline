<i>Before you jump to Thai-inspired pork meatballs with sesame-soy shredded vegetables recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as effectively as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
