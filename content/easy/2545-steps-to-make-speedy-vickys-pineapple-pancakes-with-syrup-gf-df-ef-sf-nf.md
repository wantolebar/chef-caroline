<i>Before you jump to Vickys Pineapple Pancakes with Syrup, GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Perhaps the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many individuals incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. A lot of it really is basically making use of common sense.
