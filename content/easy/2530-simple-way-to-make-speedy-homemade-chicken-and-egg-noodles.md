recipeingredient:
- " Flour 1 US cup"
- " Egg yolks or 15 to 2 whole eggs"
- " Salt"
- " Cold water"
- " Chicken thigh is nice 12 to 34 lb"
- " Onion"
- " Celery"
- " large carrot"
- " Optional"
- " Bay leaf"
- " dry thyme or a few fresh sprigs"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, let&#39;s make the noodles! Using just egg yolks gives the riches egg noodle, but as mentioned in the description, you can use 1.5-2 whole eggs instead."
- "Separate the whites from the yolk by carefully cracking the egg and letting the white fall into a bowl (make sure the yolk doesn&#39;t fall in!). *Egg whites can be kept in the fridge for 2 days or freeze well too."
- "In a bowl, mix the flour, egg yolks and salt."
- "It will be a little dry and crumbly, but once the dough starts to hold together, add about 2 Tbsp of water to get the dough just moist enough to knead."
- "Form the dough into a ball and remove to a floured working surface."
- "Knead with the palm of your hand for a few minutes until you get a smooth ball of dough. If it sticks to your hands or the surface, sprinkle more flour."
- "Once the ball of dough is nice and smooth, roll it out as thin as possible. Again, sprinkle with a plenty of flour to prevent sticking."
- "Roll the sheet of dough up like rolling a poster. Slice the dough roll to make the noodles. It can be as thick or thin as you like. Unravel the noodles and cut into smaller size. Dust with flour and let them sit out to dry out."
- "While the noodles are drying, prepare the soup. I used chicken thigh because it stays tender even if boiled, but you can use breast meat."
- "Slice the carrots and celery. Dice the onion. Leave the chicken whole."
- "Add all ingredients except the noodles to a pot and cover with water (I added about 800-900 ml / about 3.5 cups). If using bay leaf and thyme, you can add it here."
- "Bring to a boil on high, then reduce to a low simmer. Skim off any of the foam that arises from boiling the chicken. Let simmer on low for 45-60 min."
- "Remove the chicken from the soup. Pull apart the meat with two forks or with your fingers."
- "Return chicken to the pot and add salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and add the noodles. Stir, turn to low heat and cook covered for another 20-30 minutes until noodles are soft."
- "Adjust taste with salt and pepper. Serve into bowls as is, or if you *really* want to eat it country style, spoon it over mashed potatoes for a carbohydrate fest (lol). Great the next day too!"

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Chicken and Egg Noodles recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

Be smart when you do your grocery shopping. When you make good decisions at the grocery store, your meals will get healthier automatically. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with crowded grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to get home quickly and eat something beneficial. Make sure that what you have on hand is healthy. This way, even when you determine that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are lots of things you can pursue to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthy isnâ€™t just about losing weight. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
