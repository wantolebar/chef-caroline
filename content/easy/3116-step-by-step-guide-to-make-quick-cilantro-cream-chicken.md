<i>Before you jump to Cilantro Cream Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good an area to start as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. You need to upgrade your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Making use of these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than simply swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Obviously this also happens in different rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
