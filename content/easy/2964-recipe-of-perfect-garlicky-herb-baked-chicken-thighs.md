<i>Before you jump to Garlicky Herb Baked Chicken Thighs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is finished, most people do not want to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. That one flight of stairsâ€”when taken a handful of times a dayâ€”can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
