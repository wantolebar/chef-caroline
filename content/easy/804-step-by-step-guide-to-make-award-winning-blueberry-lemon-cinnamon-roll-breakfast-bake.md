- "Spoon icing mixture into small resealable food-storage plastic bag; partially seal bag. Cut off tiny corner of bag; squeeze bag to pipe over top of breakfast bake. *(I literally heated it up in the container it came in and poured it over the bake and it was great)"

<i>Before you jump to Blueberry Lemon Cinnamon Roll Breakfast Bake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Pick water over other products. Soda and coffee, when ingested in small amounts, aren't that bad. Using them for your only source of hydration, however, is dumb. Drinking water instead of other types of drinks is a good way to aid your body in its health and hydration. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories from your diet— without having to deal with terrible tasting diet food. Water is often one of the keys to successful weight loss and healthfulness.

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
