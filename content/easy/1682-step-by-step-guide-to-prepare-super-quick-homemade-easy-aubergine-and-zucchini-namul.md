<i>Before you jump to Easy Aubergine and Zucchini Namul recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as effectively as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that difficult. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
