<i>Before you jump to Red Thai Curry ðŸŒ´ðŸ¥¥ #seasonsupply #glutenfree recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
