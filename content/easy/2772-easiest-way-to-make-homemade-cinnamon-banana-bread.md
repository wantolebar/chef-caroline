Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Let us begin with something really easy, changing the actual light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. You really need to replace your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. You also have to get the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in different rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.
