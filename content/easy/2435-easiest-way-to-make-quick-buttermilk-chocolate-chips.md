<i>Before you jump to Buttermilk chocolate chips ðŸ¥ž recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

You may prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that difficult. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
