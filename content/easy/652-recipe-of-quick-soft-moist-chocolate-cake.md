<i>Before you jump to Soft moist Chocolate Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Start out with changing the bulbs. Do this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them in place of incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular are often left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice exactly how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen alone offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
