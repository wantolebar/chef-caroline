<i>Before you jump to Chocolate Mug Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle involves. Working out at the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Run the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? So many people choose the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the selections you make each day is a start. Trying to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Remember: being healthy and balanced isnâ€™t just about losing weight. You need to help make your body as strong it can be.
