Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that hard. It's about being functional, usually.
