recipeingredient:
- "800 grams grass fed beef bones"
- "3.5 litres purified water or enough to cover bones in slow cooker"
- "1.5 tbsp apple cider vinegar"
- "2 large carrots"
- "2 stalks celery"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl filled halfway with water, pour apple cider vinegar and soak the beef bones in the water for about 20 to 30 minutes. (The vinegar acts as a solvent, helping to pull calcium and other minerals from the bones as it slowly cooks.)"
- "Plug in a slow cooker and place the beef bones, carrots and celery in it. Pour purified water and turn the power to high and let it boil. Depending on the bones, there will be some foam on top. These are impurities from the bones. Check and scoop it out every 20 minutes for the first 2 hours. Lower the power to the lowest and let simmer."
- "The broth can be kept simmering anywhere from 4 to 24 hours. It’s your preference."
- "Turn the heat off and let the broth cool down slightly. Strain with a fine sieve or a muslin cloth to get rid of all the fine bones and meat. When it has cooled completely, transfer to glass jars. Keep for up to 5 days in the fridge or freeze it for future use."

<i>Before you jump to Simple homemade Bone Broth recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy.

Be wise when you do your food shopping. Making good decisions when shopping for groceries means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to deal with a hectic store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You want to go home and make a little something from your kitchen. Fill your cupboards with wholesome foods. This makes it easy to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are plenty of things you can do to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. It has more to do with making your body as sturdy as it can be.
