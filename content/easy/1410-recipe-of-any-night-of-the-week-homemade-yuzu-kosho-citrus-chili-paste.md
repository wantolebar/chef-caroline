recipeingredient:
- "4 small green chilis Japanese or Thai work well"
- "10 small yuzu or other fragrant citrus like Meyer lemons"
- "2 tbsp sea salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the yuzu skin well and zest with a microplane or zester. You can also use a knife to carefully slice off the peel, then cut into small pieces. Try not to get any of the white part underneath the skin as it&#39;s a bit bitter."
- "Chop up the green chilis and add all ingredients to a  mortar &amp; pestle (Japanese suribachi if you have it) or a small food processor. Using a mortar &amp; pestle will bring out the fragrance and flavor of the citrus a bit better."
- "Grind or process until you have a yellow-ish green paste."
- "Scrap into a glass jar (don&#39;t use plastic or metal because the yuzu kosho could pick up unwanted flavors)."
- "Cover with a bit of plastic wrap and put on the lid. Store in the fridge for several months. It&#39;s quite salty and spicy so you only need to use a little at a time!"

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Yuzu Kosho (Citrus Chili Paste) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Drink water, not other beverages. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every occasionally isn’t a terrible idea. Using them for your only source of hydration, on the other hand, is dumb. Choosing water as opposed to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. This also helps you reduce your caloric intake by hundreds of points without requiring you to buy and eat gross diet foods. Water is typically one of the keys to really slimming down and getting healthy.

There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. You want your body to be strong too.
