<i>Before you jump to Cookie dough mug cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn‚Äôt have to be a pain. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Go up the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. Obviously this isn‚Äôt as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? So many people choose the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are a whole lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Don't ignore that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You need to help to make your body as strong you can make it.
