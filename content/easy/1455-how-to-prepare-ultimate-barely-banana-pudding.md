Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Probably the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty straightforward to live green, all things considered. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
