recipeinstructions:

- "As your dough is rising and your oven is preheating you can get all of the other ingredients ready. Chop your mozzarella, bacon and chicken and set aside. Chop your mushrooms and fry in a small skillet in a lil bit of olive oil, just fry them til they are softened about 2-3 min or so. Set aside to cool a bit."

<i>Before you jump to Roasted chicken, sauteed mushrooms, fresh mozzarella and bacon ranch pizza recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is done, most people do not wish to go to the gym. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a chore. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Run the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Most people will decide to be lazy and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even just a individual flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also important. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
