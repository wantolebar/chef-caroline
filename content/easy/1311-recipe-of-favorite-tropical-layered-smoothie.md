recipeingredient:
- " For the strawberry layer"
- "1 1/2 cups sliced strawberries"
- "1/2 a large banana peeled and sliced"
- "1/2 tsp lemon juice"
- "1/4 tsp Lemon zest"
- "1/2 cup coconut milk"
- " For mango layer"
- "1/2 cup coconut milk"
- "1 large mango cubed"
- "1/2 a large banana peeled and sliced"

- " For pineapple layer"
- "1 cup pineapple cubes frozen"
- "1 small banana peeled and sliced"
- "1/2 cup coconut milk"
- " Mint leaves strawberries and chopped fruits for garnishing"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel and cut the strawberries, mangoes, pineapple and bananas and spread on butter paper or parchment paper lined pan to freeze for about 15 to 30 minutes."
- "To make the bottom strawberry layer: Remove the frozen or chilled fruit slices from the freezer. Combine sliced strawberries, half a banana, coconut milk, lemon juice and some lemon zest in a blender. Blend to a smooth paste; you may have to do it in small bursts as the fruits are frozen."
- "Divide strawberry smoothie between 2 glasses; it is easier to spoon them to form perfect layers, smoothening the top as you go. Return the glass to the freezer to set the bottom strawberry layer, for about 30 minutes."
- "To make the middle mango layer: Combine mangoes, ½ a banana, coconut milk and saffron infused mixture and blend to a smooth puree. Layer this on top of the frozen strawberry layer, leveling the top. Freeze another 30 minutes."
- "To make the pineapple layer: Combine pineapple, banana, and coconut milk in a blender and make a smooth puree. Remove the frozen smoothie glass from the freezer and layer this mixture gently over the second mango layer and level again. The layering of the smoothie can be made easier if you spoon the mixture into the glass."
- "Serve immediately or chill for another 5 to 10 minutes and serve with a straw. Enjoy!"
- "Add some honey if the mangoes and pineapples are not too sweet. For a vegan option, use sugar or agave syrup to sweeten the smoothie.  Keep frozen fruits ready in the freezer and this smoothie can be ready in no time.  If you do not want to layer the smoothies, enjoy the fruit smoothies separately as strawberry smoothie, mango and pineapple smoothies! #satwik"

<i>Before you jump to Tropical Layered Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is done, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Run the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. It is more about making your body as powerful as it can be.
