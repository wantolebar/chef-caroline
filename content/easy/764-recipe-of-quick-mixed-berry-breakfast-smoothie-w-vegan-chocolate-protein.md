<i>Before you jump to Mixed Berry Breakfast Smoothie (w/ vegan chocolate protein) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as efficiently as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
