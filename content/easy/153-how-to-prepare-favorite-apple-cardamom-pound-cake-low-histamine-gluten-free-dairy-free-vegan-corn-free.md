<i>Before you jump to Apple Cardamom Pound Cake- low histamine, gluten free, dairy-free, vegan, corn free recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Drink water, not alternative drinks. Drinking a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. Getting most of your hydration from them is a horrendous idea. Choosing water as opposed to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Effective weight loss efforts often depend solely on water intake.

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also important. Don't overlook that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
