- " wholemeal wheat flour"
- " water"
- " pepper"
- " fennel seeds"
- " rock salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat the oven to 200°C."
- "In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour, pepper and fennel seeds."
- "Add the water a little at a time and stir to mix. Different flours will absorb different quantities of water so you may need slightly more or less than the stated volume. You want the dough to be moist but not sticky."
- "Gently knead the dough on a very lightly floured surface for a few seconds, we don’t want to work it too much, just enough to bring it all together nicely."
- "Roll the dough out on the back of a flat baking tray lined with parchment paper. Use a little flour on your rolling pin to stop it from sticking to the dough."
- "When the dough is relatively flat, sprinkle the rock salt over the dough. Continue to roll the dough out as thinly as you can, pressing the seeds and salt into the dough. The thinner you roll the dough, the crispier the crackers will be."
- "Use a large knife to deeply score the dough into individual crackers."
- "Prick the dough with a fork and bake for 15 – 20 minutes, until the crackers turn a golden brown and start to curl up at the edges."

<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Start with replacing the lights. Of course you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent type, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more originally, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. Together with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in different rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and see just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. It's about being practical, most of the time.
