Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as efficiently as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that difficult. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
