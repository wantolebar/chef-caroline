<i>Before you jump to Purple sushi rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
