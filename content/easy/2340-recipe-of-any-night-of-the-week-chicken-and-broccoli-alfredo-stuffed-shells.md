recipeingredient:
- "12 oz. jumbo shells"
- "1 tbsp. olive oil"
- "2 cups chicken cooked and shredded"
- "2 cups broccoli florets cut small"
- "2 cups ricotta cheese"
- "2 large eggs"
- "to taste oregano"
- "to taste salt and pepper"

- "to taste garlic powder"
- "3/4 cup parmesan cheese shredded"
- "1 jar (14.5 oz.) Alfredo sauce divided"
- "3/4 cup mozzarella cheese shredded"
- " parsley for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start a large pot of water and 1 tbsp. of olive oil heating on high heat. Once it reaches a boil, add in the shells. Cook for 1 minute less than the time called for on the box, they will be easier to stuff this way. Once they are done, drain in a colander and immediately rinse them with cold water. This will stop the cooking process, so that they don&#39;t get any softer. Set them aside."
- "While boiling the shells, start a medium pot of water heating on high heat to start to cook the broccoli (you could also steam them). Once water reaches a boil, add in the broccoli and cook until tender (4-6 minutes). Drain broccoli and set aside."
- "In a large mixing bowl, place your ricotta cheese and crack both eggs. Whisk together until just blended. Next, whisk in the seasonings, to taste and the parmesan cheese."
- "Stir in the chicken and broccoli to the ricotta mixture and stir to combine."
- "Preheat oven to 350 F. Spray a 9x13 deep baking pan or casserole dish with non-stick spray or line with foil. Place about 1/2 of the alfredo sauce you are using onto the bottom of the baking dish and spread around. Set aside."
- "Working 1 at a time, stuff each shell with 1-2 tbsp. of the ricotta and chicken mixture. Set each one in the baking pan side-by-side once stuffed, with the opening facing up. Do this until all are stuffed. Top the shells with the remaining alfredo sauce and then sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese."
- "Cover the baking pan with foil and bake 20 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake an additional 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately. Refrigerate any leftovers."

<i>Before you jump to Chicken and Broccoli Alfredo Stuffed Shells recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy.

Consider the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will decide to be idle and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about reducing your weight. You want your body to be strong too.
