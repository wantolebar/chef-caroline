- "Make the icing: Whisk the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract, and coffee/milk together. Drizzle or spread over warm rolls."
- "Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store for up to 3 days at room temperature or up to 5 days in the refrigerator."

<i>Before you jump to Cinnamon Rolls recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. When our work day is finished, most people do not wish to go to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Water is the most effective beverage out there. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every occasionally isn’t a terrible idea. It is, however, a bad idea to only drink soda or coffee. Choosing water as an alternative to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories from your diet— without having to deal with terrible tasting diet food. Effective weight loss efforts often depend entirely on water intake.

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Wanting to get in as much exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. You want your body to be strong too.
