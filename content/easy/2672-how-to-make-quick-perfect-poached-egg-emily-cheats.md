<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as efficiently as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, after all. A lot of it truly is basically utilizing common sense.
