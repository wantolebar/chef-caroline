<i>Before you jump to Scalloped Potatoes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as economically as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
