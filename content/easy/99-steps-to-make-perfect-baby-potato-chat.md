It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Probably the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. When you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that tough. It's about being sensible, usually.
