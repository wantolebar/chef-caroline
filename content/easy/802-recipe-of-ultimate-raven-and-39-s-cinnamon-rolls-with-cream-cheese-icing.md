- "With serated knife, pizza cutter or dental floss, cut rolls into 12 to 15 pieces."
- "Place rolls touching each other in oiled 9x13 baking dish."
- "If you want bigger rolls, cut wider slices and you can also roll out dough bigger to make more rolls before filling."
- "Cover with plastic wrap or towel and let rise in warm place until double in size."
- "Heat oven to 350. Bake rolls 15 to 20 minutes or until set in center. Cover with foil if browing to fast after 15 minutes."
- "While rolls are baking, mix the cream cheese, vanilla, butter and powdered sugar until smooth and creamy. If to thick, add little splash of milk to thin slightly."
- "Spread half of the icing over hot rolls as soon as they come out of oven. This melts into nooks and crannies and is delicious!"
- "When slightly cooled but still warm, spread the rest of icing over warm rolls."
- "I hope you enjoy these as much as I do :)"

<i>Before you jump to Raven&#39;s Cinnamon Rolls with Cream Cheese Icing recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Be sensible when you do your grocery shopping. If you make smart choices when you are shopping for your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with packed grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to go to your apartment and make a little something from your kitchen. Fill your cupboards with nutritious foods. This way—even if you decide on something a bit greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still picking foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Wanting to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about losing weight. It’s about making your body as powerful as it can be.
