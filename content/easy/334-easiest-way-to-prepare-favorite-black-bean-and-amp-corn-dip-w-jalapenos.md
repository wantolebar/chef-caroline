<i>Before you jump to black bean &amp; corn dip w/ jalapenos recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Let us begin with something really easy, changing the particular light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you should use them rather than incandescent lights. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. Using these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than just swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in different rooms, not simply the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
