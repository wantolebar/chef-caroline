<i>Before you jump to Chicken Matzah Ball Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Take the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Trying to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your lifestyle choices. You want your body to be powerful too.
