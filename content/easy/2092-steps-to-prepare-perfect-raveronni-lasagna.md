- " frozen ravioli any kind you prefer I used beef"
- " Large jar of pasta sauce"
- " Large bag of shredded mozzarella cheese"
- " sliced pepperoni"
- " Oregano"
- " Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "In the baking pan you&#39;ll be using, lay out the frozen ravioli into a layer then double it. This is just so you know how many to cook. There will be 2 layers of ravioli. I fit 15 in mine so I cooked 30 raviolis. Boil according to package directions. I undercooked them a little since they&#39;ll be in the oven anyways. Drain the water and ad a bit of oil and mix to prevent sticking. Let cool in the pot to room temp."
- "Now build the lasagna. Now I realize it&#39;s called lasagna because that&#39;s the name of the noodles that are used. We&#39;re not using those noodles so why is this called lasagna you may ask? Cuz this is &#39;Merica that&#39;s why!"
- "Oil the baking dish a little. Now lay down a thin layer of sauce. Now a layer of the cooked ravioli. Next, top that with a layer of pepperoni. Now a generous layer of sauce. It&#39;s at this point I adding some extra spices. I sprinkled some oregano to give the store bought sauce a little more punch. Next top generously with the cheese. Repeat all steps."
- "Heat oven to 375. Cover baking pan loosely with foil so the cheese won&#39;t stick to it. Bake for approx. 30-40 mins or until the cheese on top is completely melted. Remove foil and bake uncovered an additional 10-15 minutes to get that nice golden brown on the cheese. Remove from oven and let cool at least 15 minutes before cutting otherwise you&#39;ll have a runny, sloppy mess. Easy prep and SO good. Enjoy"

<i>Before you jump to Raveronni Lasagna recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Be smart when you do your grocery shopping. If you make smart decisions when you are shopping for your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to deal with a hectic store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You want to go to your house and make a little something from your kitchen. Make sure that what you have on hand is healthful. This way—even if you decide on something a little greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still choosing foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get wholesome. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your lifestyle choices. You want your body to be powerful too.
