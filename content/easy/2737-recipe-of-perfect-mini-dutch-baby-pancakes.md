recipeingredient:
- "2 tbsp. unsalted butter melted and slightly cooled"
- "4 large eggs"
- "3/4 cup milk"
- "3/4 cup all purpose flour"
- "1 tbsp. granulated sugar"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1/4 tsp. salt"
- "2 tbsp. additional unsalted butter for the muffin tins"
- " nonstick spray see note in step 4"
- " confectioners sugar for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the first 2 tbsp. butter, eggs, milk, flour, sugar, vanilla and salt in a blender and mix well, until smooth and frothy."
- "Leave the batter in the blender and let it rest for at least 20 minutes. This gives the flour time to absorb the liquid. The texture and taste will be even better after it is given time to rest (or so I&#39;ve read)."
- "Place a 12 cup standard sized muffin tin (or 2 of the 6 cup muffin tins) into the oven. Preheat the oven to 425°F, with the muffin tins in the oven while it heats."
- "Once the oven is pre-heated, melt the additional 2 tbsp. of butter. Carefully remove the hot muffin tins from the oven (at this point I would recommend spraying the muffin tins with non-stick spray. I didn&#39;t the first time I tried this recipe and my Dutch babies stuck badly to the pan, even with the butter). Quickly brush the bottoms and sides of each cup with the melted butter, using a pastry brush."
- "Pour the batter into the hot, buttered muffin tins, filling to the halfway point."
- "Place muffin tins back in the oven and bake 7 minutes. Rotate the pan and bake an additional 7 minutes or until golden in color and puffy. Remove from oven. The pancakes will quickly deflate in the centers."
- "Dust with the confectioners sugar and then serve immediately, either as is or with preferred toppings."

<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
