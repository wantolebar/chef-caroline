<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Maybe the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. A lot of it truly is simply making use of common sense.
