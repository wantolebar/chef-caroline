recipeingredient:
- "2-3 lbs mince meat of your choice or mix it up with what ever meats you like I use venison and weed or wild hog"
- "1 yellow onion chopped"
- "1 clove garlic crushed then minced"
- "1 cup Italian bread crumbs"
- "1 egg"
- "1 tablespoon black pepper or less if your not a fan"
- "2 tablespoons Tony Chacheres"
- "1 tablespoon Worcester sauce"
- "1 tablespoon garlic powder"
- "1/2-3/4 cup ketchup dont want it too wet"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl lace your thawed meat. Add all your ingredients. Mix it up, this is the messy part."
- "Once you have everything mixed real good, get a 13 x 9 baking pan and spray with non-stick spray."
- "Get 8 strips of thick cut bacon, I use smoked, but use what you like, and place long ways across the middle of your baking pan so that it&#39;s hanging off the sides."
- "Next, mold you meat into a large ball you can hold in your hands and it is not falling apart. Place the ball into the middle of the layer out bacon and mold into an oblong or squared shape. You don&#39;t want it too thick or it will take a long time to cook. I like it to be no more than the height of my pinky finger. Hey! I am a southern girl, what do you want? Me to actually use a measuring cup? Lol!"
- "Next, fold bacon over the loaf in any pattern you like and secure with toothpicks."
- "Place your masterpiece in a preheated 375 degree oven for 90 min or so until it&#39;s done. Cooking time varies with the thickness of the loaf, so keep an eye on it."

<i>Before you jump to Easy southern girl Meat Loaf recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. It's about being functional, most of the time.
