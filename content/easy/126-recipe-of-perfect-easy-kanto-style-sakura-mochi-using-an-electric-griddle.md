recipeingredient:
- " Shiratamako"
- " Flour cake flour"
- " Water"
- " to 1 teaspoon Sugar"
- " Salt"
- " Food colouring red"
- " Anko"
- " to 5 leaves Cherry leaves preserved in salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Soak the salted cherry leaves in a bowl of water to remove excess salt, and drain."
- "Roll the sweet bean paste into 4 to 5 balls."
- "First, combine the shiratama-ko, sugar and salt, and dissolve in the water. (If you dissolve the two flours together at once, the mixture tends to be lumpy.) I don&#39;t add much sugar into the dough."
- "Add the flour and dissolve. Put the food coloring on the tip of a chopstick, tap it against the rim of the mixing bowl and to drop into the batter. Use a tiny bit of the food coloring."
- "Mix together, and check the color. If it&#39;s not pink enough, add a bit more."
- "Stop adding the food coloring when you think it&#39;s still a bit light. Sakura mochi looks more elegant with a lighter pink color."
- "Set the electric griddle to 160℃. Fill a ladle up to about 80% with the batter, and pour onto the electric griddle and shape into ovals. Once you&#39;ve poured on the batter, set the electric griddle on the low-heat &#34;warming&#34; setting."
- "They are done when the surfaces become dry. Don&#39;t flip them over, but transfer directly onto parchment paper to cool (with the baked side facing down!!)."
- "When cooled, place the mochi so the nicer-looking side faces outwards (with the other, less attractive side on the inside), wrap the sweet bean paste balls in the dough, and then wrap with the cherry leaves on the outside."

<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Maybe the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you make certain the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
