<i>Before you jump to Alu Anday recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as effectively as they should. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
