recipeinstructions:
- "Heat some olive oil in a pan on a medium heat and add the pork mice. Cook for 10 mins until no longer pink. Use a utensil to break the pork into small bits as it cooks. Add the onion and cook for a further 5-10 mins until the onion has softened."
- "Add the crushed garlic and season with salt and pepper. Stir for 2 mins. Add the fennel seeds and stir. Add the tomato puree and stir. Heat for a further couple of mins."
- "Add the passata (if using GF lasagne leave a little back) and the chopped tomatoes. Stir to mix."
- "Lower the heat to the lowest setting. Add a lid to the pan. Leave to simmer for 30-40 mins. Stir occasionally to avoid it sticking to the bottom of the pan."
- "One the mixture has cooked slowly, start to layer in an oven proof dish. Start with a third of the mixture. Then the lasagne sheets. Repeat two more times. (If you are using GF lasagne sheets add a bit of the remaining Passata to the pasta sheets - adding a layer of liquid will prevent them from being chewy)."
- "Add the mascarpone to another pan with the milk and a generous crack of pepper. Stir on a low heat until all the mascarpone has melted. This only takes a few minutes."
- "Add the sauce to the lasagne."
- "Top with cheese (I used a mixture as that’s what I had in the fridge - but use whatever cheese and how much you like). Add a crack of pepper. Cook in the oven at 200c for approx 30 mins or until the cheese has started to colour."
- "Remove, add the garnish (optional) and serve."

<i>Before you jump to Pork &amp; Fennel Lasagne recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. At the conclusion of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Run the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are many things you can go after to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about losing weight. You need to help to make your body as strong you can make it.
