Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
