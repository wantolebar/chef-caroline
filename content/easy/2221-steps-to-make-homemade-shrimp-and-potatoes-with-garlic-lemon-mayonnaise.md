recipeingredient:
- "8 Frozen peeled shrimp"
- "2 medium Potatoes"
- "3 pods  Fava beans optional"
- "2 1/2 tbsp Milk"
- "2 tbsp Mayonnaise"
- "2 tsp Lemon"
- "1 tsp Grated garlic"
- "1 tsp Sugar"
- "1 dash Salt and pepper"
- "1 1/2 tbsp each Cake flour katakuriko"
- "1 Ketchup"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the potatoes and slice into 7 mm chunks. Run water over the slices, and microwave for 2 minutes."
- "Mix together the ● garlic, sugar and mayonnaise, then add milk and mix well. Add lemon juice and salt and pepper at the end. Mix after each addition."
- "Rub salt and pepper into the cleaned and dried shrimp. Season the potatoes with salt and pepper also. Boil the fava beans quickly and peel off the skin."
- "Coat the ingredients with cake flour and katakuriko, and deep fry in hot oil until crisp (you can also shallow fry in 1 cm of oil)."
- "Drain on paper towels or a rack, mix with the ● ingredients while still hot and it&#39;s done."
- "If you are shallow frying the ingredients, start by frying the shrimp first since they have moisture. This minimizes oil splatter since there is more oil in the pan at the start. Follow up with the potatoes and beans which need less oil to fry."

- "When fava bean season is over, edamame are delicious in this, too. There are beans all year round. Use whatever beans are in season."
- "I recommend serving this with crispy raw vegetables like lettuce and mizuna greens. You can double the sauce and use some of it as salad dressing."
