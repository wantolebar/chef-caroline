<i>Before you jump to ChefMasterDad&#39;s Deviled Egg Salad Boats recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Will Save You Cash</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
