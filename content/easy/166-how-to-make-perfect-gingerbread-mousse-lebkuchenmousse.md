<i>Before you jump to Gingerbread mousse (Lebkuchenmousse) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. It's concerning being functional, more often than not.
