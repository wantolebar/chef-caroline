<i>Before you jump to Easy &amp; Fluffy Pancake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Probably the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that tough. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
