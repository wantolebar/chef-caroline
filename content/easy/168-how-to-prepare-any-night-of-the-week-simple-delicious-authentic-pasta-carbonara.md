recipeingredient:
- "180 grams Spaghetti or Fettucine if available"
- "1 1/2 tbsp to 2 liters of water Salt for boiling the pasta"
- "1 Olive oil"
- "70 grams Salted pork  seeor thickly cut bacon"
- "2 large Fresh Egg"
- "4 tbsp Parmigiano Reggiano grated Or use pregrated parmesan cheese"
- "1 Coarsely ground black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring a large pot of well-salted water and boil the pasta. (For a chewy pasta and for seasoning)."
- "[Basic] Boil with well-salted water to make the pasta well seasoned and give it a clearer taste. It&#39;s not necessary to add more salt when stirring the pasta in a frying pan."
- "In a large bowl, beat the egg with the Parmigiano Reggiano, black pepper, and salt until the egg becomes fluffy."
- "Heat olive oil in a frying pan. Fry the pork with low heat. The pork fat releases oil so you don&#39;t need to use too much. If there&#39;s too much oil, take it off with a paper towel."
- "When the pork is crispy, cool it down a bit and put it into the bowl with the eggs. Add the fat from the pork, too. (←it has a good taste)"
- "When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with pasta tongs and put it in the bowl and mix it. Tip: Don&#39;t drain the pasta too much. Use the heat of the pasta to coat the strands well with the egg liquid."
- "Serve topped with Parmesan cheese (not listed in the ingredients) and a generous amount of ground pepper. Enjoy! This classic recipe is really simple, and tastes rich but not cloying."
- "Who added cream to Carbonara, the Americans? Or was it the Japanese? The authentic taste is similar to the classic Japanese dish of raw egg mixed with hot rice."

<i>Before you jump to Simple! Delicious! Authentic Pasta Carbonara recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

Water is the most effective beverage out there. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every occasionally isn’t a horrible idea. It is, however, a bad idea to solely drink soda or coffee. When you choose water more than other beverages you are helping your body remain very healthful and hydrated. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Water is usually one of the keys to really reducing your weight and becoming really healthy.

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get wholesome. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent about the choices you make each day is a start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also critical. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your lifestyle choices. It is more about making your body as strong as it can be.
