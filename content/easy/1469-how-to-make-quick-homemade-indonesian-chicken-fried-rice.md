<i>Before you jump to Homemade Indonesian Chicken Fried Rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Water is the most effective drinks out there. Soda and coffee, when used in moderation, aren't that bad. It is, however, a bad idea to only drink soda or coffee. Ingesting water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to aid your body in its health and hydration. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories away from your diet— without having to resort to terrible tasting diet food. Successful weight loss efforts often depend entirely on water intake.

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done every single day, can do a great deal to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about losing weight. It has more to do with making your body as sturdy as it can be.
