Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Maybe the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is going. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, after all. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
