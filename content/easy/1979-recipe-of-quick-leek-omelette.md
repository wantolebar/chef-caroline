<i>Before you jump to Leek Omelette recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Maybe the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
