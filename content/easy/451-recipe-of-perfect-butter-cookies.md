It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment.

Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Start with replacing the bulbs. Do this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you should use them in place of incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The family spends major time in the kitchen area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house as well. Do an exercise if you like; check out the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
