- "Once sauce is mixed well, remove from heat, cool down."
- "Cut meat in about 1 inch cubed."
- "Mix cooked sauce with meat. Let stay in marinade for at least 1 hour, overnight is much better. Pork and beef seems to like longer to pick up the flavor over chicken."

- "Skewer onion piece, meat, onion piece, etc. Onion should be on each end. I usually like about 5 pieces of meat pet skewer."
- "Now cook for about 12 minutes, twisting about every 3 or 4 minutes."
- "I find by using the onion only, with 1 inch meat cubed, these cook evenly without raw or overcooked parts. Be careful, the sugar can cause excessive chasing if the heat is too high."
- "You can grill these, stove top grill, broil in oven, might be able to use an electric clam shell grill, never tried that."

<i>Before you jump to Onion &amp; Orange kabobs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a chore. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Run the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Trying to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about reducing your weight. It has more to do with making your body as strong as it can be.
