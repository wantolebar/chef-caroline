That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as efficiently as they should.
