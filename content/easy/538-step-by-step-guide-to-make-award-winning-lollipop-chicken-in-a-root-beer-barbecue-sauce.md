<i>Before you jump to Lollipop chicken in a root beer barbecue sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These kinds of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
