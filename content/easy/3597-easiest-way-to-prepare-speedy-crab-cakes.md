<i>Before you jump to Crab Cakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

You may possibly prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. Particularly if you make certain the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that hard. It's about being practical, most of the time.
