Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is definitely not true. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
