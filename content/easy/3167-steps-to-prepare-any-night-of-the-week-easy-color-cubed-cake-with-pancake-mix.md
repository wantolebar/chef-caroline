- "If talking about flavor, I like marzipan better than soft candies, but this was easier to do."
- "Once you have decorated it however you choose, it&#39;s done."
- "There&#39;s no sugar added to the cake batter, so it&#39;s just mildly sweet."
- "Try drizzling some maple syrup over the top of the whipped cream when enjoying this cake. I also recommend spreading syrup onto the cakes before adding the whipped cream."

<i>Before you jump to Easy Color-Cubed Cake with Pancake Mix recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as effectively as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Typically, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
