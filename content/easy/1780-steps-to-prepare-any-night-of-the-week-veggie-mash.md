<i>Before you jump to Veggie Mash recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. It's concerning being functional, usually.
