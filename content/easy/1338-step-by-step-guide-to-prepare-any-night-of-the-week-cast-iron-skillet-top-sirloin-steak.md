recipeingredient:
- "1.5 pound TOP sirloin at least a inch thick"
- " Kosher salt"
- "2 Tbsp. Cooking oil"
- "3 Tbsp. Unsalted butter"
- "5 sprigs thyme"
- "5 cloves garlic"
recipeinstructions:
- "First make sure the cut is Top sirloin, it is a different cut than sirloin and make sure it is at least an inch thick, more fat the better."
- "Prep: 50 minutes before cooking, take the steak out of the fridge and dry it thoroughly with paper towels. Then season with LOTS of kosher salt and some pepper. Let your seasoned steak sit out at room temperature for 45 minutes."
- "Dry your steak once again with paper towels. Add two tablespoons of cooking oil to the skillet and place the skillet on the stove at high heat."
- "Keep the heat at super high, and let the steak cook for 2 minutes without touching it. After 2 minutes, flip your steak and start to brown the other side."
- "Continue to flip every 2 minutes until your steak reaches an internal temperature of 130 degrees (rare). A 1 inch-thick top sirloin steak will get to 120 degrees in about 6-8 minutes."
- "Basting: Turn heat down to medium and add 3 Tablespoons of unsalted butter to the pan. Let the butter melt and just barely start to bubble, then add about 5 sprigs of thyme and the garlic. Then baste the steak by spooning the melted butter over the top of it, repeatedly."
- "After a minute, flip the steak and keep basting. Check the temperature again until 155 degrees. If not repeat until temperature is 155."
- "Put the steak on the cutting board and let it rest for 10 minutes. Slice the meat before serving and place each slice a serving platter. Add the sprigs of thyme to the top of the steak and pour a few spoonfuls of the fat from the pan over the sliced steak."

<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Begin with exchanging the light bulbs. This will certainly go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more initially, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. It goes further than merely replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly discover members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. This additionally occurs in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that tough. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
