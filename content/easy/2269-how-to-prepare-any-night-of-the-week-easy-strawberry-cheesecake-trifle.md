<i>Before you jump to Easy Strawberry Cheesecake Trifle recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
