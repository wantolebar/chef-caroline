Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
