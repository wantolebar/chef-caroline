<i>Before you jump to Breedom Asian Style Pork Rice Bowl recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Begin with changing the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. You need to change your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more initially, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen area, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty straightforward to live green, after all. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
