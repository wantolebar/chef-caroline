<i>Before you jump to Boiled fava beans recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
