recipeingredient:
- " oats"
- " crisp rice cereal"
- " ground flaxseed"
- " unsalted butter"
- " honey"
- " salt"
- " coarsely chopped graham cracker pieces"
- " mini marshmallows  an additional handful"
- " dark chocolate chips"
recipeinstructions:
- "Optional first step : Spread out the oats in a baking sheet and bake them in the oven at 350°F for 10 or so minutes until they are golden and toasted. Keep a close eye on them though, as they can burn quickly. Toasting the oats beforehand just adds a nice flavor to the finished bars, so this step is optional."
- "Line a 8x8&#34;or a 9x9&#34; pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to easily lift the finished bars out and set aside."
- "Place the oats, rice cereal, ground flaxseed and about a handful of mini marshmallows into a large bowl and set it aside."
- "In a medium saucepan, start heating your butter over medium heat. Once it begins to melt, whisk in the honey and pinch of salt. This will form a kind of sticky caramel sauce, which will be the glue that holds the bars together. Let this come to simmer, then remove from heat."
- "Pour the sauce over the ingredients in the bowl and stir them all together using a rubber spatula. The marshmallows that are in the bowl will melt. Once everything is incorporated, allow this to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Then fold in the rest of the marshmallows, the Graham cracker pieces and the chocolate chips."
- "Pour this mix into the prepared baking pan and use either a spatula or another pan or your hands to press down on the granola mixture very firmly. Whatever you&#39;re using to press down the granola, spray it first with non-stick cooking spray. Its important to really pack it down hard or you&#39;ll end up with crumbly granola chunks instead of bars."
- "Place the pan into the fridge for at least 2 hours. Then, remove the granola from the pan using the parchment paper. Use a large, sharp knife to cut it into bars (or squares)."
- "That&#39;s it! For grab and go convenience, you can individually wrap these using parchment paper and string or you can wrap them in plastic wrap. Store them for up to 1 week. They&#39;re a bit hard and crunchy straight out of the fridge, so I&#39;d recommend letting them sit out at room temperature for a few minutes before eating."

<i>Before you jump to S&#39;mores Granola Bars recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Be smart when you do your grocery shopping. If you make smart choices when you are shopping for your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with crowded grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to get home quickly and have something great. Make sure that what you have at home is healthful. This makes it easy to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is naturally better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are a whole lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about slimming down. It is more about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
