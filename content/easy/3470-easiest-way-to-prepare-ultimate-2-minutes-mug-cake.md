Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
