<i>Before you jump to Beet Tulsi Juice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is complete, most people do not wish to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Climb stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. It’s about making your body as powerful as it can be.
