recipeinstructions:

Butter will get foamy and if you swirl the pan around, you will see brown bits at the bottom and it will have a nutty smell. Remove from heat and pour into a small bowl. Make sure to get all those browned bits at the bottom of the pan, that is where all the flavor is. Allow to cool until it becomes solid or refrigerate to speed up the process."

- "Add the dry ingredients to wet ingredients. Mix until just combined."
- "Stir in one cup of M&amp;M&#39;s. Chill dough for at least one hour or overnight."
- "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Roll dough into balls, around 1½ Tablespoons of dough per cookie. Press a few extra M&amp;M&#39;s onto the top of each dough ball. Bake for 7- 9 minutes. Cookies will look underdone, but set up perfectly once they cool. Do not over bake or the cookies will be dry. Makes 24-30 cookies."

<i>Before you jump to Brown Butter M&amp;M Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is complete, most people do not wish to go to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Choose water over other drinks. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every occasionally isn’t a terrible idea. It is definitely, however, a bad idea to solely drink soda or coffee. Drinking water instead of other types of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Water is typically one of the keys to really losing weight and leading a healthful lifestyle.

There are a good deal of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about losing weight. You need your body to be strong too.
