It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that hard. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
