<i>Before you jump to Gourmet Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as economically as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. It's related to being sensible, more often than not.
