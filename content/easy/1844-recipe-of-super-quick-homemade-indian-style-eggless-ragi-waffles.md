<i>Before you jump to Indian Style Eggless Ragi Waffles- recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Start with changing the bulbs. Do this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you will need to use them rather than incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Coupled with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The family spends major time in the kitchen area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This additionally happens in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is simply using common sense.
