Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good an area to start as any. This will certainly go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent style, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This additionally takes place in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that difficult. A lot of it truly is basically using common sense.
