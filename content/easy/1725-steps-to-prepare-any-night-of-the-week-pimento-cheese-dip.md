<i>Before you jump to Pimento Cheese Dip recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Start with changing the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent style, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly come across members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
