<i>Before you jump to Mix fruit salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Take the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't forget that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You need to help to make your body as strong it can be.
