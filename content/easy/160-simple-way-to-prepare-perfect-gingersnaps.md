<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. It's about being sensible, more often than not.
