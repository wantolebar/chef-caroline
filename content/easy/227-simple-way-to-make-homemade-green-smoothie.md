<i>Before you jump to Green Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

When you go grocery shopping, be sensible about it. When you make wise choices at the grocery store, your meals will get healthier automatically. Think for a minute: you don't want to go to a chaotic grocery store or sit in a lengthy line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You’re going to go home and cook what you have on hand. Make sure that what you have on hand is healthy. This way—even if you choose something a bit greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still choosing foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are plenty of things you can do to become healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about slimming down. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
