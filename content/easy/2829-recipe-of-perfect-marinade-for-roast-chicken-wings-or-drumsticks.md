<i>Before you jump to Marinade for roast chicken wings or drumsticks recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Let's begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than simply replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house as well. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a little common sense.
