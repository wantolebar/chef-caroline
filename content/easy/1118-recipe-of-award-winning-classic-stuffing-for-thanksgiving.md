recipeingredient:
- " Weekend Before"
- " large rolls or a rustic loaf of bread"
- " Thanksgiving Day"
- " fresh sage"
- " thyme"
- " fresh rosemary"
- " unsalted butter"
- " large yellow onion"
- " celery"
- " garlic"
- " lowsodium turkey chicken or vegetable broth"
- " large eggs"
- " sea salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "The weekend before Thanksgiving: Cut the rolls into 1 inch cubes, and put into 1 gallon zip lock bag (make sure to vent to allow moisture to escape) for storage in refrigerator until Thanksgiving Day. This is an important step, because you want the bread to stale so that it dries out in the fridge. On Thanksgiving if the bread isn’t hard enough put it into the oven on 170 degrees for 15-30 mins until firm enough."
- "Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit."
- "Set aside rosemary. Clean and remove leaves from thyme sprigs. Finely chop the sage. (note: Safeway Poultry Blend of fresh herbs is exactly enough for this meal)"
- "Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and garlic and cook for 2 minutes before adding celery, stirring occasionally, cook until very soft for about 10 minutes."
- "Stir in the sage and thyme and cook for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat."
- "Combine the toasted bread and onion mixture together in a large bowl. Fold mixture together until evenly distributed."
- "Place the broth, eggs, and salt into a medium bowl, season with ground pepper if desired, and whisk to combine. Pour over the bread mixture and stir until evenly combined."
- "Lightly grease a 9x13–inch baking dish. Transfer the bread mixture into the baking dish and spread into an even layer. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and drizzle over the top. Finally add the fresh rosemary on top. There are two ways to do this depending on preference, put the sprig of rosemary on top, or break it up and spread sparingly across the top (my preference)."
- "Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil, shinny side towards the bread mixture. Bake for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. Uncover and bake until the top is golden-brown, about 15 minutes more."
- "Let the dressing cool for 10 minutes before serving."
