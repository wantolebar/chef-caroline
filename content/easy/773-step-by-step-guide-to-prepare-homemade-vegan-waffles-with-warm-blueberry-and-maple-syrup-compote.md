- "When the waffles are golden brown, carefully remove and divide between plates. Repeat two more times for the remaining 2/3 mixture."
- "Pour over the blueberry and maple syrup compote."

<i>Before you jump to Vegan waffles with warm blueberry and maple syrup compote recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is complete, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some hints to be as healthful as possible.

Climb stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are many things you can go after to become healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your lifestyle choices. It’s about making your body as powerful as it can be.
