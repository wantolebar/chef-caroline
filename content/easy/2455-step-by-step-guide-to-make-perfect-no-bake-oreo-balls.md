<i>Before you jump to No Bake Oreo Balls recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good an area to begin with as any. Do this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to obtain the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house as well. Do an exercise if you like; check out the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that tough. It's concerning being functional, usually.
