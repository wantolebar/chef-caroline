Changing light bulbs is actually as good a place to begin with as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them in place of incandescent lights. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.
