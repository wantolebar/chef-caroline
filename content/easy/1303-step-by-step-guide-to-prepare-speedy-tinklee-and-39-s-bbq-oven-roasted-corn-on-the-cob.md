<i>Before you jump to Tinklee&#39;s BBQ/Oven Roasted Corn on the Cob recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a place get started on as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than merely swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. This also happens in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen alone offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
