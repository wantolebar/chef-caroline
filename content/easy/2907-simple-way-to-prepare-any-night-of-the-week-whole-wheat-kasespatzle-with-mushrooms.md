recipeinstructions:

- "When ready to cook spätzle, bring a large pot of water to boil. Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F. Also prepare a big bowl of warm water which you will use to put the spätzle to keep warm and to prevent sticking together while you cook all the batches."
- "Make the spätzle in 3-4 batches. You can do it with a spätzle press, or by pressing the batter through a large-holed colander or tray like I&#39;m doing in the photo. You can also use a cutting board by putting some batter at the edge of the board and cutting little pieces off with a knife directly into the boiling water."
- "Let the spätzle boil for a minute or two until they float up to the top. Scoop them out with a draining spoon..."
- "And put into the bowl of warm warm. Continue to cook the remaining batches of spätzle, transferring each batch to the bowl of water when done."
- "While the spätzle are cooking (or afterwards), you can also start to saute the onions and mushrooms. Melt butter in a saucepan or frying pan and add the sliced onions and mushrooms."
- "Saute on on medium low until the onions are very soft and translucent. Add the heavy cream if using and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Turn off heat and add a sprinkle of salt and pepper to taste."
- "Drain the spätzle well and mix into the onion and mushroom &#34;sauce&#34; along with the parsley. Taste a little and add more salt and pepper if needed."
- "Transfer the spätzle to a casserole dish, and lightly mix in about 2/3 of the cheese so it&#39;s evenly distributed. Use the last 1/3 of the cheese to sprinkle over the top."
- "Put in the preheated (180°C/350°F) and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and just a little browned on top (more or less to your preference)."
- "Remove and serve immediately!"

<i>Before you jump to Whole Wheat Käsespätzle with Mushrooms recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle demands. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.

Take the stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are a whole lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. It is more about making your body as powerful as it can be.
