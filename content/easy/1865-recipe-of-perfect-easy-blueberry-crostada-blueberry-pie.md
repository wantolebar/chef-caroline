- "Once you have the dough ready, take a sheet of parchment paper and lay it on your kitchen counter.  Put the dough on it and start kneading the dough softly with your hands so as to form one big mound of dough.

- "While the dough is refrigerating, wash and dry the blueberries(I washed them in a big strainer and transferred to a big tray and used a paper towel to wipe off moisture).  Then transfer the berries to a medium size bowl, add the sugar, corn starch and the salt and mix slowly and gently with a rubber spatula(if you have one) just so you don&#39;t squeeze the berries too hard. Make sure all the corn starch and sugar is mixed uniformly with the berries.  There your filling is ready."
- "Next after the dough has been in the fridge for an hour, get it back on the parchment paper on your counter.  Whack it gently using your rolling pin to loosen it up. Then put some flour on the parchment paper and also on your rolling pin and roll the dough slowly into a circle about 12 inches long.  every now and then make sure its not sticking to the parchment by adding more dusting flour."
- "Preheat oven to 400 deg F."
- "Next, slide the parchment paper with the pastry dough  circle onto a large baking sheet/tray. Now place the filling slowly and carefully in the middle of the pastry dough and slowly use the parchment paper to fold the outside edges of the pastry dough around the outside of the filling leaving only the inside filling exposed.(see picture)."
- "Lastly, brush the outside edges of the pastry with ice water and sprinkle sugar all over the tops and edges.  Bake at 400 degrees F for about 45-50 minutes. I would recommend checking after 35 minutes to see if the filling is boiling. It should boil for about 5 minutes so that the corn starch dissolves completely."
- "Take the crostada out of the oven when the crust is nice and golden and the filling has been bubbling for about 5 minutes. Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Easy Blueberry Crostada (Blueberry Pie) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Start out with replacing the light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. You need to upgrade your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Using these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. In the kitchen is where you'll usually discover members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house as well. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and discover exactly how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
