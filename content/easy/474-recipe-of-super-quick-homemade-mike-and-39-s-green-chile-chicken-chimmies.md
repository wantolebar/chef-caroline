- "On no stick tinfoil, bake chicken breasts at 350° for 40 minutes. Slightly cool and chop [or shread] chicken into bite sized pieces. Note: If your chicken is still pink in color or its juices don&#39;t run clear, bake an additional 5 to 10 minutes until fully cooked."
- "Make sure your veggies in the, &#34;Bean Mixture,&#34; category are chopped finely since they will need to soften [cook] in the microwave."
- "Mix everything in the, &#34;Bean Mixture,&#34; category together well and microwave for 3 minutes. Stir well and microwave 3 additional minutes. Place back in microwave and heat for 4 more minutes and let it sit until you&#39;re ready to construct your chimichangas."

- "Fold down top and bottom of tortilla over beans and then fold in the sides. Secure the middle and edges with toothpicks. Make sure there are no openings for beans or cheeses to escape. Repeat process for all 6 chimichangas."
- "Heat 2&#34; deep oil on high and place 2 chimichangas in your pan toothpick sides down. Do not overload your pan as it will cool off your oil and saturate your burritos. Your bean mixture is fully cooked so you&#39;re only browning and crisping your tortillas. Fry chimichangas about 1 minute on each side. Be careful not to burn."
- "Drain chimichangas on paper towels and serve on a bed of lettuce, [or fresh cabbage if you desire] and top with additional garnishments. These vegetables can also act as a taco salad side dish. REMEMBER TO REMOVE ALL TOOTHPICKS! :0)"
- "If you choose to oven bake these, follow the same instructions but bake at 350° for 30 minutes [or until browned] turning once."

<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s Green Chile Chicken Chimmies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Water is the most effective beverage out there. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every now and then isn’t a horrible idea. Using them for your only source of hydration, conversely, is dumb. Ingesting water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Water is often the main element to successful weight loss and healthfulness.

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also critical. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your lifestyle choices. You really want your body to be strong too.
