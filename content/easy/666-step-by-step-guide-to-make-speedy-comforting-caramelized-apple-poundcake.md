- " Cake flour"
- " Almond flour"
- " Eggs L"
- " Unsalted butter"
- " Granulated sugar"
- " Caramelized Apples"
- " Walnuts sliced almonds etc optional"
- " For the syrup"
- " Sugar"

recipeinstructions:
- "Preliminaries: Line the poundcake tin with glassine paper. If the pan has a nonstick finish or is made of silicone, grease it with vegetable oil."
- "Preliminaries: Have the eggs and butter at room temperature. Sift the ◆ cake flour and almond flour together twice from a height to incorporate lots of air into them, even if it seems like a lot of work."
- "Make the caramelized apples and leave to cool. See- make sure to cook off all the excess moisture that comes out of the apples.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/146241-caramelized-apple"
- "Put the room temperature butter in a bowl and mix until it&#39;s glossy like mayonnaise. If the butter is at room temperature it will reach the mayonnaise-like stage right away."
- "Add all the granulated sugar to the creamed butter at once. Beat with a handheld mixer until it&#39;s white and fluffy, about 10 minutes."
- "After 10 minutes of beating, it will seem like the butter has increased in volume."
- "Break an egg into a separate bowl and beat it very well before adding to the butter-sugar mixture. Use a handheld mixer for this again."
- "Add the 2nd egg in the same way. If you add 2 eggs at once the batter may split. Cold eggs may make the batter split too."
- "Add the caramelized apples and the ◆ sifted flours all at once. Mix by scooping up the batter from the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula."
- "Turn the bowl counter-clockwise while scooping up the batter clockwise with a rubber spatula from the bottom of the bowl to mix. The batter in this photo is not mixed enough yet."
- "Don&#39;t overmix the batter, but do mix it properly until it&#39;s glossy! When it&#39;s no longer floury and has turned shiny, stop mixing."
- "Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin. To prevent the apples from sinking to the bottom, don&#39;t do the usual air-elimination step of dropping the pan from a height onto your work surface."
- "Add some crushed walnuts, sliced almonds etc. to taste (optional)."
- "Bake for 20 minutes in a preheated 180°C oven, then lower the heat to 170°C and cover with aluminium foil and bake for another 20 minutes."
- "While the cake is baking, make the syrup. Put the sugar and water in a small pan and mix. Bring to a boil, let cool and add the rum."
- "When the cake is baked and has cooled enough that you can touch the pan, brush the surface evenly with the syrup. You don&#39;t have to use up all the syrup."
- "After cooling the cake for a while, wrap it up in foil and rest in the refrigerator for a day. The cake can fall apart easily right down the middle, so handle it gently."
- "The butter in the cake doesn&#39;t taste good unless it&#39;s chilled and hardened, so wait a day."
- "When the cake is just out of the refrigerator it&#39;s hard and firm, so leave it at room temperature for a while before eating. It will be silky and moist."
- "Apples and nuts go so well together. I like to add lots of walnuts personally."
- "Here I added caramelized bananas instead of apples to make a caramelized banana poundcake. I topped it with chocolate chips."

<strong>Methods To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, nevertheless it will save you money to use it over your oven. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, of course. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
