<i>Before you jump to Stuffed Pepper recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that tough. It's about being practical, more often than not.
