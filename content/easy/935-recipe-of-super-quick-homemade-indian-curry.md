<i>Before you jump to Indian Curry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Let's begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Do this for your house, not just the kitchen. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent type, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than simply exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The family spends major time in the kitchen area, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
