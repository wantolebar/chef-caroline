<i>Before you jump to Super Easy Chicken Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Take the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also important. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
