<i>Before you jump to &#39;V&#39; Scottish Dundee Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Start with exchanging the bulbs. This will go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Along with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
