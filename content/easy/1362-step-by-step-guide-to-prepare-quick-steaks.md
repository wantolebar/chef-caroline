By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
