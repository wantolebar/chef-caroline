It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Let's begin with something really easy, changing the particular light bulbs. This will certainly go outside of the kitchen, but that is okay. You should upgrade your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a small amount more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to acquire the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The kitchen lights especially will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This additionally occurs in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. Mostly, all it will take is a little common sense.
