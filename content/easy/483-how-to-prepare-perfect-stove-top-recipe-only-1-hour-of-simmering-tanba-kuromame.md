recipeingredient:
- " Kuromame black soybeans"
- " Unrefined brown cane sugar powdered"
- " Sugar"
- " Soy sauce"
- " Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "The fresher the bean, the plumper the result. Rinse the beans, then drain. Either lumped or powdered cane sugar is fine."
- "The proportion of black soybeans to the combined amount of sugar should be 1:1. I used the proportion of 3:1 for unrefined brown cane sugar to refined sugar."
- "Bring the sugar, soy sauce, and water to boil in a pot, then turn off the heat and let cool. When it cools, add the black soybeans and soak overnight."
- "After soaking overnight, the wrinkles should almost disappear and they&#39;ll look reconstituted like this."
- "Since the skins will break if brought to a boil too quickly, cover with a lid and simmer for 1 hour over low heat. Do not allow the water level to go below the level of the beans."
- "After simmering, they should be plump and tender all the way through. If they are still hard, simmer until they reach this degree of tenderness."
- "To allow the flavors to completely blend, cover with a lid and let sit overnight. The beans should settle to the bottom."
- "Transfer to a dish, then serve. If storing, be sure to store in the liquid and keep it above the level of the beans. Otherwise, the beans will become wrinkled."
- "Note - I tested the proportion of 1:1 for kuromame to sugar. The color was slightly reduced and the sweetness increased. I recommend this method when using the beans for sweets since they are not strong-tasting."

<i>Before you jump to Stove Top Recipe - Only 1 Hour of Simmering! Tanba Kuromame recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. A lot of it truly is basically utilizing common sense.
