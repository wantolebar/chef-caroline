recipeingredient:
- "20 grams Shiratamako"
- "30 grams Flour cake flour"
- "80 ml Water"
- "1/2 to 1 teaspoon Sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "1 dash Food colouring red"
- "60 grams Anko"
- "4 to 5 leaves Cherry leaves preserved in salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Soak the salted cherry leaves in a bowl of water to remove excess salt, and drain."
- "Roll the sweet bean paste into 4 to 5 balls."
- "First, combine the shiratama-ko, sugar and salt, and dissolve in the water. (If you dissolve the two flours together at once, the mixture tends to be lumpy.) I don&#39;t add much sugar into the dough."
- "Add the flour and dissolve. Put the food coloring on the tip of a chopstick, tap it against the rim of the mixing bowl and to drop into the batter. Use a tiny bit of the food coloring."
- "Mix together, and check the color. If it&#39;s not pink enough, add a bit more."
- "Stop adding the food coloring when you think it&#39;s still a bit light. Sakura mochi looks more elegant with a lighter pink color."
- "Set the electric griddle to 160℃. Fill a ladle up to about 80% with the batter, and pour onto the electric griddle and shape into ovals. Once you&#39;ve poured on the batter, set the electric griddle on the low-heat &#34;warming&#34; setting."
- "They are done when the surfaces become dry. Don&#39;t flip them over, but transfer directly onto parchment paper to cool (with the baked side facing down!!)."
- "When cooled, place the mochi so the nicer-looking side faces outwards (with the other, less attractive side on the inside), wrap the sweet bean paste balls in the dough, and then wrap with the cherry leaves on the outside."

<i>Before you jump to Easy Kanto-Style Sakura Mochi Using an Electric Griddle recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is done, most people do not wish to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Take the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also critical. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. It has more to do with making your body as sturdy as it can be.
