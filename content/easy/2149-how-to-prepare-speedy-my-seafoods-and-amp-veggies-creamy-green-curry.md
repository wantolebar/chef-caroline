<i>Before you jump to My Seafoods &amp; Veggies Creamy Green Curry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle demands. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Drink water, not alternative drinks. Sipping a soda or cup of coffee every so often won't hurt you too badly. Using them for your only source of hydration, on the other hand, is dumb. Choosing water as an alternative to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories out of your diet— without having to resort to terrible tasting diet food. Water is usually one of the keys to really slimming down and becoming really healthy.

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your lifestyle choices. It is more about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
