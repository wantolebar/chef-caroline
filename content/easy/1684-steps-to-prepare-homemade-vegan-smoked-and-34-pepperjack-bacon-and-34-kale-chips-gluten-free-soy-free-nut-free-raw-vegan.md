<i>Before you jump to Vegan Smoked &#34;Pepperjack-Bacon&#34; Kale Chips (Gluten free, Soy Free, Nut free, Raw, Vegan) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
