It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around.

You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. Typically, all it requires is a little common sense.
