<i>Before you jump to Mini almond cake in microwave recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
