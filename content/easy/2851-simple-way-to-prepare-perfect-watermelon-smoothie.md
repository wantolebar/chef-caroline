<i>Before you jump to Watermelon smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Start with changing the lights. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them in place of incandescent lights. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Making use of these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The kitchen lights especially will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
