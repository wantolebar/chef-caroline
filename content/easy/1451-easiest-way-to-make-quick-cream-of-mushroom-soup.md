<i>Before you jump to Cream of Mushroom soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
