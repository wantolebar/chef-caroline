- "2 Sweet Potatoes"
- "2 Tablespoons Butter Melted"
- "2 Tablespoons Brown Sugar"
- "2 Tablespoons Butter Melted"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 375"
- "Wash and peel the Sweet Potatoes, cube them up into roughly two inch chunks – you’re going for uniformity here, try to get all the chunks roughly the same size so they bake evenly."
- "Pam spray a baking sheet and toss your potato chunks on there. Pour your first portion of 2TBSP melted butter over the potatoes and push them around to try and get them all coated a bit."
- "Bake for around 35 minutes – keep an eye on them for burning and make sure to stir them once in a while. Browning is good, burning is not :-)"
- "When they’re done, take them out of the oven and decide how you’re going to mash them! You can use a food processor or a blender(if you have one) to puree them, you can just pour them into a bowl and smoosh them with a large fork or a potato masher if you like. It all ends up pretty much the same."
- "After you’ve mashed up the potatoes, add the remaining 2 TBSP melted butter and the 2 TBSP of Brown Sugar and mix it all together."
- "Enjoy!!"

<i>Before you jump to Sweet Potato Mash recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is finished, most people do not wish to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Climb stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are many things you can go after to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being intelligent when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Looking to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about losing weight. It has more to do with making your body as sturdy as it can be.
