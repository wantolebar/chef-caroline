<i>Before you jump to Thai Green Curry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as efficiently as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can easily minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that difficult. It's related to being functional, more often than not.
