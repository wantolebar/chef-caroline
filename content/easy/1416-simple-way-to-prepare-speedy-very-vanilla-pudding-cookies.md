<i>Before you jump to Very vanilla pudding cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Start with replacing the bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a little bit more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. Together with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The family spends a lot of time in the cooking area, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This also takes place in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that difficult. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
