<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Probably the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
