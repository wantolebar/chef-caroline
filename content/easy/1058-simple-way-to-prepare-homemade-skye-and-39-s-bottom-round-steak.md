It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as economically as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, after all. A lot of it truly is simply making use of common sense.
