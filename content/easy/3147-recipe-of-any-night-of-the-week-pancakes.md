<i>Before you jump to Pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Probably the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and perhaps this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
