<i>Before you jump to Hasselbeck potatoes with yummy carrot and coriander soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
