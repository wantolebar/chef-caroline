<i>Before you jump to Low carb (pumpkin)pap(Akamu) for weight loss recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as economically as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that difficult. It's concerning being practical, most of the time.
