Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. Especially if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's concerning being sensible, more often than not.
