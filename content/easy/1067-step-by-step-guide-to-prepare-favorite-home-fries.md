<i>Before you jump to Home fries recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
