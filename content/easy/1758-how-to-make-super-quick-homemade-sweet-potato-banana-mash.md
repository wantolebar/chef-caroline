Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Perhaps the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that hard. It's about being functional, most of the time.
