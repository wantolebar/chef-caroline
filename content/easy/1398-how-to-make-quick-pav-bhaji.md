<i>Before you jump to Pav bhaji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the actual light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. You should change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than merely replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights especially will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This also occurs in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and see how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
