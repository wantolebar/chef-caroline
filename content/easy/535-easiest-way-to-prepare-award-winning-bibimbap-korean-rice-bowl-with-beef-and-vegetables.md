<i>Before you jump to Bibimbap (Korean Rice Bowl with Beef and Vegetables) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
