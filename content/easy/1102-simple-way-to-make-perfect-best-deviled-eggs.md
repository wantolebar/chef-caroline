It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
