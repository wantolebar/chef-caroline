<i>Before you jump to Turkish poached eggs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. It's about being functional, most of the time.
