Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electrical power is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.
