recipeingredient:
- "1 kilo chicken cut into pieces"
- "1 head garlic 45 garlic cloves crushed and the remaining minced"
- "2 tablespoons oil"
- "4 pieces bay leaves"
- "1/2 tablespoon peppercorn"
- "1/2 cup white vinegar sugar cane or balsamic goes well too"
- "1 cup soy sauce"
- "1/4 cup water"
- "1/2 tablespoon sugar"
- " Optional peeled hardboiled eggs andor potatoes cut in quarter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Marinate chicken in soy sauce and vinegar with the crushed garlic for at least 2 hours or even overnight. The longer the chicken stays in the marinade, the tastier and flavorful it becomes."
- "Heat oil in pan and cook remaining minced garlic until light golden brown. Set aside toasted garlic as toppings later. Remove chicken from the marinade (keep marinade sauce) and pan fry chicken in the same oil as the garlic for about 3-5 minutes per side or until it browns a little. Don&#39;t worry about having to cook chicken through just yet, as you will still let it stew later."
- "Put back marinade sauce from earlier and add water, sugar, peppercorn, and bay leaves. Add optional potatoes and peeled hard-boiled eggs. Let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes. You will know chicken is cooked once it is fork tender is starting to release oil. I like my adobo on the drier side so I let the it simmer until the sauce thickens and mostly evaporated."
- "Serve with white rice topped with toasted garlic and enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Filipino Chicken Adobo recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good an area to start as any. Complete this for the entire house, not merely the kitchen. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. It goes further than merely exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The family spends major time in the kitchen, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice exactly how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
