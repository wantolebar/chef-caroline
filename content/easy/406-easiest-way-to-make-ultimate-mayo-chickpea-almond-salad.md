<i>Before you jump to Mayo chickpea almond salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Maybe the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and perhaps this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
