<i>Before you jump to Banh Mi (Vietnamese Pulled Pork Sandwich) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, of course. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
