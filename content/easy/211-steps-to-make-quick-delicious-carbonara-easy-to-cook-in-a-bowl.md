<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Maybe the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
