recipeingredient:
- "12 Meatballs"
- "150 g Carrot"
- "2 x stalks Celery"
- "2 x Small Onions"
- "1 x Tablespoon Tomato Paste"
- "1/2 Beef stock cube"
- "500 g Tomato Passata"
- "3 Big Garlic Cloves"
- "200 ml water"
- " Fresh Basil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the onions, carrots and celery. I like to get the carrots pretty small, as I don&#39;t personally like big chunks of carrot, but realise cutting them small can test your patience."
- "Fry the onion in nice big drizzle of oil, after a couple minutes add the carrots, and then the celery. I&#39;m not trying to cook them through, just to soften them a little at this stage."
- "Mince the garlic, and add to the pan. I like to make a little well in the middle with a little more oil, and cook the garlic for roughly a minute, as I don&#39;t want it to burn."
- "Now transfer the contents of the pan to the slow cooker. Add a generous tablespoon of tomato paste, and the passata. I like to mix half a stock cube with hot water, pour this in to the passata container, and swirl it around before pouring in the slow cooker, this gets the last of the passata left in the container. Finally add the meatballs in, and set the slow cooker to low."
- "On low between 6-8 hours is the sweet spot, I find any longer and the meatballs overcook and end up dry and mushy. I cooked this one for 7 hours total."
- "Now cook your spaghetti so it is slightly hard, I usually aim for 1 minute less than the packet recommends. Drain, and then add back into the hot pan with a couple ladles of the sauce. Keep stirring through, making sure to coat all of the spaghetti with the sauce. Then distribute it into bowls, topping up with extra sauce, the meatballs, and freshly chopped Basil."

<i>Before you jump to Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs (Slow Cooker version) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. Working out at the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Select water over other refreshments. Soda and coffee, when consumed in moderation, aren't that bad. Getting all your hydration from them is a horrendous idea. Choosing water as an alternative to other beverage adds to your body's health and allows it stay hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories from your diet— without having to deal with terrible tasting diet food. Water is often the key to successful weight loss and healthfulness.

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the choices you make each day is a start. Trying to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about losing weight. You really want your body to be powerful too.
