<i>Before you jump to Healthy Strawberry &amp; Blueberry Oatmeal Protein Bar recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of electricity is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that hard. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
