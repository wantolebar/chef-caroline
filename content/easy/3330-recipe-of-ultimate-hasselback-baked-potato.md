recipeingredient:
- "1 large Potato"
- "10 ml olive oil"
- "500 ml warm water"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "1 pinch ground black pepper"
- " Other seasoning spices as per choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Soak the potato in warm water for about 10 minutes"
- "Clean the skin of potato. We will need the skin in place."
- "Cut a 5mm slice from the edge of the potato so as to make a flat surface. We will rest the potato on this side."
- "Now make 3-5 mm slices gently. Make sure not to cut down fully. You must stop the slicing at about 5mm above the base so that it does not get separated. Repeat until entire potato is sliced."
- "Now soak this sliced potato in water till the starch separates."
- "After a while take the potato out and pat dry. Place it on a baking tray and drizzle some olive oil. Sprinkle salt and crushed pepper. You may add thyme, Chilli Flakes or Oregano if you like. I personally like to add slivers of butter between the slices."
- "Bake at 220°C for 50-55 minutes. Pause in between to re apply the dripped oil/butter into the potato. You will notice the slices separating once done. If you like about halfway through you can add some butter to make it more buttery flavoured."
- "Serve hot. Just pull away the slices and enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Hasselback / Baked Potato recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as efficiently as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is simply utilizing common sense.
