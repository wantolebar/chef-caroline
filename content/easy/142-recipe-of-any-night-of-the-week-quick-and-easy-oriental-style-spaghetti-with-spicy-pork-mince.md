Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as economically as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.
