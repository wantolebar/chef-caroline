recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit. If your oven runs extra hot and has a tendency to obliterate your food, try 375."
- "Prep your ingredients - peel and chop your onion and crush your garlic, set aside. Rinse, peel and slice carrots into thin coins. Measure out peas and let them sit at room temperature. Roughly chop basil and set aside separately."
- "Lightly rinse a large saucepan and shake out excess water into the sink. Set it on low-medium heat on the stove. Once water droplets have evaporated, melt 1/2 stick of butter plus 1 tbs olive oil in pan. Let it heat thoroughly for a couple of minutes. Stir or swirl the pan for even heat distribution and to prevent premature browning or burning. Adjust heat as needed."
- "Add onions and garlic into the pan, and sautee for a few minutes until onions are translucent and garlic is lightly browned. Add in remaining butter and oil, and heat through."
- "Once additional butter has melted, stir in carrots and peas into the pan. Once carrots are cooked but still slightly firm, add lemon juice, chicken stock, and basil. Stir occasionally."
- "In a separate container, mix half and half and tapioca flour together. Whisk until blended and smooth. Gently pour into pan and stir."
- "Continue to stir and let the mixture thicken for a minute or two, then add in the pre-cooked shredded chicken. Add in herbs and spices. Taste and add desired amount of salt. Stir to combine. Turn heat down to a simmer and stir frequently as the mixture comes together and is heated through. Do not boil."
- "Remove the pan from heat. Gently pour mixture into prepared crust pan. (pictured: my plant-based pie crust)"
- "Carefully take premade top crust and cover the filling. Using your index fingers and thumbs, firmly pinch the edges to seal the top of the pie. You can trim excess dough with food-safe scissors. Take a fork or butter knife and gingerly make 3 small slits starting at the center of the pie and outward to create ventilation. Evenly brush the top and edges with prepared egg-wash or water."
- "Cover the edges of the pie crust with foil to prevent premature browning. Place pie in heated oven on the center rack, and place a foiled cookie sheet on the rack below to catch any drips. Let bake for 35-40 minutes."
- "Check on pie. If top is still heavily doughy, add time in 5 minute increments until top is golden brown. If filling bubbles up, it&#39;s okay! And if the top of the pie crust is mostly golden brown but has some slightly softer spots it&#39;s okay; it will keep cooking outside of the oven. Remove from oven with mitts and let it sit on top of the stove for 10 minutes. Place on cooling rack for at least 25 min before serving to let it set. Caution: it will be hot. As pies directly from the oven tend to be."
- "Cut desired portions and transfer to plates. Serve it with joy and pride."

<i>Before you jump to Jo&#39;s Chicken Pot Pie Filling recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Begin with replacing the light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you will need to use them in place of incandescent lights. They cost a little bit more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, of course. It's about being sensible, usually.
