<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as efficiently as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
