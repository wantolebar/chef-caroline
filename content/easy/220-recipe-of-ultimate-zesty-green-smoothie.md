<i>Before you jump to Zesty Green Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good a spot to start as any. Complete this for your house, not only the kitchen. You should replace your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Coupled with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular are often left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
