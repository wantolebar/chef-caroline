Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
