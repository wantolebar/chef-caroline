Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you should use them rather than incandescent lights. Although costing a little more originally, these bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. It goes further than merely replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular are often left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there.

Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.
