<i>Before you jump to Brad&#39;s Marinated Flank Steak &amp; Ravioli Marinara recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Why don't we begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. Do this for the whole house, not just the kitchen. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it truly is merely using common sense.
