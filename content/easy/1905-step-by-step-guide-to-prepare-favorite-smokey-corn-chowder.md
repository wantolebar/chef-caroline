These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Along with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly come across members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed.

Do an exercise if you like; check out the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, after all. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
