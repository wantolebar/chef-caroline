<i>Before you jump to Banana Oats Muffins Vegan recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Let's begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Do this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent type, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than merely swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The family spends major time in the kitchen area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This also takes place in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
