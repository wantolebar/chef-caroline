It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as economically as they should.

You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty straightforward to live green, of course. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
