That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, of course. Mostly, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
