<i>Before you jump to Chocolate Mug Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, all things considered. It's about being practical, more often than not.
