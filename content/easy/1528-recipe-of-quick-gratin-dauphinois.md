<i>Before you jump to Gratin Dauphinois recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesnâ€™t have to be a chore. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Run the stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a whole lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the decisions you make each day is a start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also important. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your health levels. You want your body to be powerful too.
