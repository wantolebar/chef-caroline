<i>Before you jump to Cheesy chili spaghetti squash casserole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as economically as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. Typically, all it requires is a little common sense.
