<i>Before you jump to Easy Korean sponge cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. It's about being functional, more often than not.
