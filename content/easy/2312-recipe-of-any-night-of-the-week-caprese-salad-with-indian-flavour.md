<i>Before you jump to Caprese salad with Indian flavour recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Let's begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen area. You really need to upgrade your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights especially tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
