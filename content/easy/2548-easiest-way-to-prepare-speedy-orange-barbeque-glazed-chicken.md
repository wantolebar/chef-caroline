It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Begin with changing the light bulbs. Do this for your house, not merely the kitchen. You really need to change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
