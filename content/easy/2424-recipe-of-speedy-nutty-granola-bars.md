<i>Before you jump to Nutty Granola Bars recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Start with replacing the bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. Using these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently discover members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
