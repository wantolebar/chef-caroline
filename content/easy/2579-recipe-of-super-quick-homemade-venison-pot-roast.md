<i>Before you jump to Venison pot roast recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
