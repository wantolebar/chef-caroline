recipeinstructions:
- "Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need. Flour and Saffron not pictured."
- "Fine chop your vegetables. Add butter, onions, celery, garlic, thyme, black pepper, salt, bay leaves and Old Bay to your pot. Stir well and simmer for 10 minutes until vegetables are slightly translucent. Stir regularly. You don&#39;t want to burn your garlic."
- "Add your flour and stir well and often for 5 minutes. You&#39;re burning out that flour taste."
- "Drain your clams and reserve all fluids. Set clams to the side."
- "Add all fluids to your pot.   Peel and chop potatoes into 1/2&#34; cubes. Place them in pot. You&#39;re peeling and chopping your potatoes last since they will brown unless soaked in water."
- "Simmer for 20 minutes or, until your potatoes have softened.   Add salt and pepper to taste."
- "At this point you&#39;ll have the option to thicken your chowder. You&#39;ll do it at this point exactly since as the potatoes soften, they will thicken the broth.   To thicken: Add 2 tablespoons Corn Starch to 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl and mix well. Slowly add your starch mixture and allow pot to simmer back up. It&#39;ll thicken up quickly. Add additional starch to thicken more. I usually add the full 2 tablespoons but it&#39;s your call."
- "Add your clams, stir and simmer 1 minute. No longer or you&#39;ll have extremely chewy clams.   Pull pot from heat source and cover."
- "For the croutons:  Slice baguette bread into 1&#34; cubes.   Add 2 tablespoons butter and a dash of garlic oil or, couple dashes of garlic powder a pan and heat.   Place croutons in heated butter. Fry for 3 minutes or, until crispy and coated.   Fine chop parsley and add to pan. Mix quickly and well.   Drain croutons on paper towels. Serve immediately."

<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as efficiently as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
