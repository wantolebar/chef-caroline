<i>Before you jump to Easy and Fluffy Steamed Breakfast Cake Made with Pancake Mix recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as efficiently as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
