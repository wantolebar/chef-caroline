Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not that tough. It's about being sensible, usually.
