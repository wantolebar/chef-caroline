Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is definitely not true. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. It's about being sensible, more often than not.
