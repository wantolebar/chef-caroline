<i>Before you jump to Korean Kimchi recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These types of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good an area to start as any. Do this for the whole house, not just the kitchen. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Along with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular will often be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Certainly this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
