<i>Before you jump to Italian Style Meatloaf Pepper Rings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of electrical power is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to operate as often.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty straightforward to live green, after all. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
