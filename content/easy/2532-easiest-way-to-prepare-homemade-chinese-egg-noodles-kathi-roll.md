<i>Before you jump to Chinese Egg noodles kathi roll recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Maybe the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically effective when it's full before a cycle is going. Preserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. It's about being practical, usually.
