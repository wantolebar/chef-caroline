recipeingredient:
- " bamboo skewers soaked in water for at least an hour"
- " boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into roughly 15inch cubes to the extent that you can cut chicken thigh meat into cubes which is to say not really"
- " minced garlic about 3 cloves"
- " minced fresh ginger root or you could use about 14 teaspoon dry ginger powder"
- " green onion finely chopped"
- " sugar"
- " gochujang Korean red chili paste You can substitute with sriracha  not quite the same but youll get a tasty result"
- " low sodium soy sauce"
- " kosher salt"
- " neutral oil like vegetable canola grapeseed"
- " large onion cut into 1 pieces for skewering and tossed with 2 teaspoonfuls of oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, mix together all the ingredients except the onion, making sure to incorporate all of them thoroughly."
- "Cover the bowl and set in the fridge to marinate (about 1 hour ideally, and not more than 2). Remember to take the meat out of the fridge about 30 minutes before you&#39;re ready to grill.  If you&#39;re using a charcoal grill, start your coals about 20 to 25 minutes before you want to grill. You want a gentle, medium low heat over which to cook these kebabs.  If gas, just pre-heat your grill to medium low 5 to 7 minutes before cooking."
- "Skewer your kabobs so they look like this.  6 single layers of onion with 5 roughly 1&#34;layers of chicken skewered between them. As you&#39;ve probably discovered by now, it&#39;s a little challenging to get 1&#34; cubes of meat from chicken thighs, but you generally want a 1&#34; thickness of meat between veg, so you might have to add odd pieces of chicken to the bigger ones to achieve this thickness.  I used only onions mostly because I think it tastes simple and delicious this way."
- "Over a medium low grill, cook the kebabs about 15 minutes, covered, turning them every 5 minutes."
- "Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Dak Bulgogi (Korean Style Spicy Chicken) Kabobs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is finished, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Drink water, not other drinks. Soda and coffee, when ingested in small amounts, aren't that bad. It is, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. Ingesting water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Water is typically one of the keys to really reducing your weight and getting healthy.

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get wholesome. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. Little things, when done each day, can do a lot to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Trying to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Don't overlook that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It is more about making your body as powerful as it can be.
