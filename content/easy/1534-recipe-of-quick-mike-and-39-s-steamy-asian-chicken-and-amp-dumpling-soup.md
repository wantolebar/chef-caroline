<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s Steamy Asian Chicken &amp; Dumpling Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is going. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Typically, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
