recipeingredient:
- " Sweet potato"
- " Milk"
- " Heavy cream"
- " Eggs"
- " Raw cane sugar"
- " Maple syrup  roasted sesame"
recipeinstructions:
- "Leave the milk and eggs out at room temperature. Wash the sweet potato and cut into 3 or 4 pieces. Wrap in aluminum foil while still wet."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 200℃ for 30 to 40 minutes, until a skewer can be inserted easily. Remove the skin and prepare 150 g."
- "You can use a steamer, but I do not recommend using a microwave. Using a microwave causes the sweet potato to lose it&#39;s sweetness. Baking is best."
- "Combine and mix the ★ ingredients with a blender. Pour through a sieve and smooth using a rubber spatula. Pouring through the sieve takes some effort but you get an even smoother texture."
- "Pour the liquid into the containers, line up on a warm baking tray, and fill the pan with enough water to come up to half of the containers. Steam in the preheated oven at 150 ℃ for 20 to 25 minutes."
- "Once a film has formed on the top, shake the containers a bit. If it&#39;s stiffened to the point where only the center jiggles, remove from the oven and cool."
- "You should aim for just before it completely stiffens and has just a bit of softness left to it. It tightens upon cooling, so it&#39;ll be slightly stiffer than right after baking."
- "Once it&#39;s fully cooled, top with maple syrup and sesame and it&#39;s complete! Of course caramel sauce is also delicious!"
