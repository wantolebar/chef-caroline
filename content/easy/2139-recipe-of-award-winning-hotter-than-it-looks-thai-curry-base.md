recipeingredient:
- "1/4 yellow onion finely minced"
- "1/4 cup very finely chopped cilantro andor basil This is a great use for all those stems"
- "2 Tablespoons finely minced ginger"
- "2 Tablespoons finely minced garlic"
- "3 serrano chilies finely minced Thai bird chilies are ideal and Chiles de arbol would also work well here"
- "1 Tablespoon crushed red chili flakes like the kind you use on pizza and pasta"
- " the zest of 1 lime or 3 kaffir lime leaves finely julienned"
- "2 Tablespoons oil"
- "1-2 teaspoons curry powder depending on how strong a curry flavor you prefer"
- "1 Tablespoon fish sauce"
- "1 Tablespoon lime juice"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1 teaspoon sugar"
- "1 can coconut milk theyre usually somewhere between 13 and 15 ounces"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a preheated medium high pan, saute the aromatics - onion, garlic, ginger, chilies, chili flakes, and lime zest - in the 2 Tablespoons of oil until the onions are translucent. Add the curry powder, stir to incorporate, and let the curry bloom for a minute or so."
- "Add the remainder of the ingredients and stir to incorporate thoroughly, turn the heat up to high, and bring the curry to an active boil for a minute."
- "Add in your protein and veg and bring the curry back up to a boil for a minute or so, turn the heat down to medium high, and let it simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes, or until your protein is cooked through. Bite sized pieces of seafood will take no time at all (3 to 5 minutes), white meat chicken a little bit longer (5 to 7 minutes), and dark meat yet longer (7 to 10 minutes)."
- "Give it a stir, adjust the seasoning if needed - a little more salt or fish sauce if you want it saltier, a little more lime juice if you like extra tang, maybe a pinch more of sugar to round out all the flavors - simmer another minute or two, and that&#39;s it! Serve with steamed rice."
- "For the curry in this pic I used: 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined (I used 31/40 size), 1/2 pound button or crimini mushrooms, 1/2 pound snow peas, 1/2 red bell pepper cut into 1/4-inch strips, and an 8 oz can (the short one) of bamboo shoots, drained. But you can of course use whatever veg you like and have handy, following the general measurement guidelines of 1 pound of protein and 1 pound of veg for 4 servings."
- "Enjoy! :)"

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.
