- "In a skillet over medium heat, drizzle in some sesame oil.  Once the oil is heated up, add in the chicken mixture.  Immediately, rinse the bowl with 1/4 cup of warm water.  Pour the water mixture into the skillet with the chicken.  Cover and cook for 7 to 8 mins.  *Check at 5 mins mark to prevent any burning. The chicken breast should be cooked thru&#39; with tender juiciness and not tough and dry.*"

Brush the top with sesame oil.   Grill until almost charred.   Flip the dough.   Immediately turn the heat down to medium-low."
- "Spread the spicy chicken over the pizza dough evenly. When you think it is not enough, it is enough. Less is always more.  Sprinkle mozzarella over the top, distributing them evenly. Again, less is more.  Immediately cover the griddle to generate steam so that the cheese will melt.   As soon as the cheese melts and the bottom is charred, remove the cover.   Remove the pizza from heat and transfer onto a serving plate."
- "Immediately. scatter scallions and black sesame over the top.  Repeat the steps for the remaining pizzas.   Slice and serve immediately."

<i>Before you jump to My Grilled Pizza: Buldak | Korean Spicy Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These types of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Start out with exchanging the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Making use of these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to obtain the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house at the same time. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
