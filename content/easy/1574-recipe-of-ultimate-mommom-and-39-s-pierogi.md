recipeinstructions:
- "5lbs of potatoes makes about 100 pierogi. We always made a lot at one time because they take a lot of time to make. Mommom always had a large group together to make them and split up the duties. She would do 10 to 20 lbs of potatoes at a time."
- "Peel, cube and boil the potatoes."
- "Sauté an onion in a stick of butter."
- "I used a mixer to mash the potatoes. Add the onion and butter mixture and cheese. I said 2 lbs but you can make it as cheesy as you like. My mommom always made them so cheesy the mashed potatoes were stretchy."
- "To make the dough (i don&#39;t have measurements for this because we always did it by feel) You may have to make more than 1 batch of dough. We had to make a 2nd batch."
- "Add flour to a large mixing bowl and add two eggs and some sour cream. Mix with your hand if the mixture is dry add some more sour cream. Once the mixture comes together kneed on the counter. The mixture will become sticky just add more flour. Let dough sit for about 10 minute."
- "Set a large pot on the stove to boil."
- "Roll a piece of dough out as thin as you can get it. While rolling out the dough you will need to add more flour and make sure you have plenty on the counter under the dough. Use a biscuit cutter or large glass to cut a circle. Place about a tablespoonful of potato mixture fold over dough and pinch closed. Your going to be making half moon shapes."
- "Once you have some made place a few at a time into the pot of boiling water. Once they float, this happens quickly, remove from pot. If you want to freeze them you stop at this point and let them cool and freeze. If your eating them right away continue to the next step."
- "If your going to eat these the same night put a sauté pan on with onions, as much as you like, and butter. You may go through a couple lbs of butter with this recipe."
- "Put the boiled pierogis in the saute pan with butter and onions until lightly golden brown. Once golden brown they are ready to eat. My family always ate them with a little sour cream and a side of sauerkraut."

<i>Before you jump to Mommom&#39;s Pierogi recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be irritating. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Pick water over other products. Sipping a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. It will be, however, a bad idea to solely drink soda or coffee. Ingesting water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. This also helps you reduce your caloric intake by hundreds of points without requiring you to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Water is ordinarily one of the keys to really losing weight and leading a healthful lifestyle.

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get wholesome. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
