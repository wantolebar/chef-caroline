<i>Before you jump to Korean Style Lettuce Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, after all. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
