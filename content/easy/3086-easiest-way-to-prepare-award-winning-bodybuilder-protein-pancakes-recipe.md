<i>Before you jump to BODYBUILDER PROTEIN PANCAKES [+Recipe] recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is going. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
