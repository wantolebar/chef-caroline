<i>Before you jump to Scalloped potatoes with onions recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that hard. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
