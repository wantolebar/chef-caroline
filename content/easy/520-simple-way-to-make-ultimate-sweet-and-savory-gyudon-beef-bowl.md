<i>Before you jump to Sweet and Savory Gyudon (Beef Bowl) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as effectively as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that difficult. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
