<i>Before you jump to Macrobiotic Caramelized Apples recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the conclusion of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Climb stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are a whole lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about slimming down. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
