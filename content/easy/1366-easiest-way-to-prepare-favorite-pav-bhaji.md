<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
