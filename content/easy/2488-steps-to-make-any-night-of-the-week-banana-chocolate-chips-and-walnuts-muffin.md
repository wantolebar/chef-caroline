Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that hard. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
