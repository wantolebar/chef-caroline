<i>Before you jump to Keto Lasagna recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is specifically effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that difficult. It's about being practical, usually.
