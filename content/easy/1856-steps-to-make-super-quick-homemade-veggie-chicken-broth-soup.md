recipeinstructions:
- "Combine first 7 ingredients together in a pot over medium heat.  Drop in leeks once you see bubbles starting.  Let it boil for 30 to 40 minutes, depending how large your chicken pieces are."
- "When chicken is cooked, drop in all of your sliced leafy greens before you take out the chicken.  Cook until veggies are done, about 7-10 minutes.  Remove chicken if you&#39;re using it for another dish. If it&#39;s only poaching, you need to remove chicken earlier, especially if cooking breasts.  I like using bones in and skin on because it makes the broth tastier, cooking it longer too to get the flavour.  Do a taste test before turning off heat, add salt or pepper or more broth powder as desired.  Serve as a side soup or entree while hot. Garnish with cilantro, leaves only (optional)."

<i>Before you jump to Veggie Chicken Broth Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are many things you can pursue to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Trying to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
