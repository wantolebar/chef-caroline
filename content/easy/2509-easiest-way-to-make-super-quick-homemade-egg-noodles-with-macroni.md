<i>Before you jump to Egg Noodles with  macroni recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it really is basically making use of common sense.
