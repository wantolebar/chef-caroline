recipeingredient:
- " To make about 30 ml of sweet chili sauce"
- "5 tbsp Vinegar grain vinegar"
- "2 tbsp Sugar"
- "1/5 tsp Salt"
- "2 Red chili pepper or fresh chili pepper"
- "1 clove Garlic grated"
- " To make about 120 ml of sweet chili sauce"
- "300 ml Vinegar grain vinegar"
- "8 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 1 teaspoon Salt"
- "6 Red chili peppers or fresh chili peppers"
- "3 clove Garlic grated"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the stems and seeds from the red chili peppers. If you don&#39;t like it spicy, discard the seeds, and soak the chili peppers in the vinegar. But if you don&#39;t mind it spicy, soak the chili peppers together with the seeds in the vinegar to rehydrate."
- "When the chili peppers have become soft, finely chop them and put them back in the vinegar. Add the garlic, sugar, and salt to adjust the basic taste of the sauce."
- "Transfer to a pot, and turn on the heat. Over high-medium heat, let the sauce boil until it reduces to 1/2-1/3 while agitating the pot."
- "Skim off the scum while the sauce is bubbling away. When it&#39;s nearly done, the bubbles will become bigger, so watch it carefully..."
- "When the sauce slightly thickens, it&#39;s done. When it&#39;s cool, it will thicken more. If you are making a small quantity, you can make it in the microwave, but be careful not to let it boil over!"
- "Tips: If you don&#39;t like a strong sour taste, you can replace half of the vinegar with water. Compared to store-bought sweet chili sauces, this sauce is a little less sour and sweet."
- "So, using this sauce as a base, adjust the amount of chili pepper and sugar to suit your own taste."

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Sweet Chili Sauce for Spring Rolls recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle involves. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesnâ€™t have to be a chore. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Water is the most effective beverage out there. Soda and coffee, when used in small amounts, aren't that bad. Using them for your sole source of hydration, on the other hand, is dumb. Ingesting water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to aid your body in its health and hydration. This also helps you lower your caloric intake by hundreds of points without having to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Water is typically one of the keys to really reducing your weight and becoming really healthy.

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Don't overlook that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You need your body to be powerful too.
