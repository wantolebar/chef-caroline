<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

You may prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it truly is simply utilizing common sense.
