<i>Before you jump to Chicken Burritos recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as efficiently as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that tough. A lot of it really is merely making use of common sense.
