<i>Before you jump to Brussel Sprout Salad with Bacon and Blue Cheese recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as effectively as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is simply using common sense.
