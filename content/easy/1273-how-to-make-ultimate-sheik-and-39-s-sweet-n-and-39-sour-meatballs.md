<i>Before you jump to Sheik&#39;s Sweet N&#39; Sour Meatballs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. It's about being practical, usually.
