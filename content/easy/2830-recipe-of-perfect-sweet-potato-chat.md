That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as effectively as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.
