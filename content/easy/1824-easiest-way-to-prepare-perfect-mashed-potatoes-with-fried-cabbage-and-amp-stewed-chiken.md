<i>Before you jump to Mashed potatoes with fried cabbage &amp; stewed chiken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, after all. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
