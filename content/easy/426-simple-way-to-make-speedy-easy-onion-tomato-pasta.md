It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Although it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, after all. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
