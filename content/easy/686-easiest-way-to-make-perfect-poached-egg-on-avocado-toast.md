- "2 egg"
- " Vinegar"

recipeinstructions:
- "Toast the bread. I usually use a grill rather than a toaster to control the browning."
- "Carefully cut the avocado in half, remove the stone and scoop out the avocado flesh."
- "Add a little lemon juice to the avocado and mash to your desired constancy and set aside. The lemon is important, it stops the avocado from going off quickly."
- "Heat some water. As it comes to a boil, add some vinegar to the the water."
- "Secret technique - gently crack an egg into a sieve and allow the extra egg white to drain off. You&#39;ll notice that there is still an egg yolk and the main egg white. The extra egg white causes the stringing when you usually poach an egg. Once this is removed, you have a nice, smooth, bubble like raw egg ready for poaching."
- "Stir the boiling water to create a vortex and gently add the egg into the water. Boil for 3 minutes for a runny yolk. You can do two at a time, but I stick to 1 so they don’t interfere with one another. You may need to adjust your time to have your yolk to the consistency that you like."
- "Use a slotted spoon to fish out the egg and place on a kitchen towel to absorb any excess water."
- "Spread the avocado on the toast, add the poached egg, salt and pepper to taste and it’s ready to eat. Enjoy!"
- "Side note: My friend kept wanting to add chilli flakes to the avocado smash, but I’m not sure the flavour comes through. Have a go and see for yourself."

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as effectively as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to run less frequently, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it is basically utilizing common sense.
