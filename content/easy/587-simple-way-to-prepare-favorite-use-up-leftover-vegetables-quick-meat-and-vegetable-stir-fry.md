Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money.

When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove.
