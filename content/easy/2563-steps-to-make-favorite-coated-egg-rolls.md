It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as economically as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, after all. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
