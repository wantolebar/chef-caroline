Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, after all. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
