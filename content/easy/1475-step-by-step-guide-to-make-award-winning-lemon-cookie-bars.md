<i>Before you jump to Lemon Cookie Bars recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as efficiently as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
