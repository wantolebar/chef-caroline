recipeinstructions:
- "Combine flour herbs (parsley) salt and pepper and mix well with a whisk, now add eggs"
- "Add the water then with the whisk create a thick slurry in the well, when the mixture starts getting a bit too thick for the whisk, time to use a wooden spoon and beat the mixture smooth."
- "When the batter is smooth cover with cling film for 10 minutes to allow all the liquid to absorb into the flour. The 3rd image shows the thickness of the batter after the 10 minutes."
- "I found the mixture a little bit too thick so I added a splash of water, I wanted the batter to be able to pass through the holes of my colander into the salted boiling water below. I have seen this technique done by simply using 2 spoons to drop the batter into the water, (there is no wrong way to do this)"
- "Use a spoon to push the batter through the holes into the salted boiling water below, let this boil for a few minutes"
- "Fry the bacon and onion in a pan with a little olive oil and butter if you like, use a slotted spoon to transfer the spätzle into the frying pan. Stir over a lowish heat for a couple of minutes then add more chopped herbs (opt)"
- "Add some of the parmesan into the pan and stir, if the mixture is a little dry reserve some of the cooking water to add. I poured in about 50 ml to moisten the dish, if you added too much just stir over the heat until it evaporates."
- "I finished the dish with lots of black pepper and more parmesan and herbs, this really is a technique recipe for the spätzle so feel free to add any additional ingredients that you like with gnocchi or pasta. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdcpmtFuUkI&amp;t=1s"

<i>Before you jump to Spätzle recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. When our work day is complete, most people do not wish to go to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Run the stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about reducing your weight. You want your body to be powerful too.
