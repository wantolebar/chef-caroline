The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity.
