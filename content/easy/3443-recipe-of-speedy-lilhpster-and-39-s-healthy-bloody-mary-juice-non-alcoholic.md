It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that difficult. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
