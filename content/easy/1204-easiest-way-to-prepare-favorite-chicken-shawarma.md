<i>Before you jump to Chicken shawarma recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Do this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. You need to change your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
