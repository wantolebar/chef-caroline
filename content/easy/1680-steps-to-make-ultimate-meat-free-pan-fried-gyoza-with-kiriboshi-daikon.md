recipeinstructions:
- "Soak the kiriboshi daikon in water for 5 minutes to rehydrate. Cut the kiriboshi daikon into 5-mm pieces. Cut the shiitake mushrooms into 5-mm-dices. Chop the Japanese leek into slightly smaller dices. Grate the ginger and keep only the juice."

- "After the moisture has evaporated, (do not allow the mixture to get too dry) add the ginger juice, Japanese leek and Chinese garlic chives. Season with pepper and stir gently. Turn off the heat. Leave to cool."
- "After cooling, wrap the gyoza dumpling skins around the filling. The filling will reduce in size when it is cooked, so use much more filling than for a normal gyoza. Otherwise the end product will be too flat."

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Start with changing the lights. Do this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. You need to change your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a small amount more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The kitchen lights especially tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house at the same time. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
