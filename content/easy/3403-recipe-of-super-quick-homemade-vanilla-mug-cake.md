<i>Before you jump to Vanilla mug cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is done, most people do not want to go to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Select water over other drinks. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every once in a while isn’t a terrible idea. Getting all your hydration from them is a horrendous idea. Choosing water as opposed to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories away from your diet— without having to deal with terrible tasting diet food. Successful weight loss efforts often depend solely on water consumption.

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about slimming down. It is more about making your body as powerful as it can be.
