<i>Before you jump to Easy beef and potatoe wedges with salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

You may possibly prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, all things considered. It's related to being functional, usually.
