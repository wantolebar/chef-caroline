<i>Before you jump to Chicken Panino recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as economically as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
