The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy.

Making use of these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly discover members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed.
