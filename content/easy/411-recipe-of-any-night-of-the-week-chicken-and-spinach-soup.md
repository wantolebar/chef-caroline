Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. It's related to being functional, usually.
