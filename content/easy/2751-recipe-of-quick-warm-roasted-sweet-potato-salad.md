It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Probably the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is not true. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, of course. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
