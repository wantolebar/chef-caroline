<i>Before you jump to Huzzar Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as economically as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
