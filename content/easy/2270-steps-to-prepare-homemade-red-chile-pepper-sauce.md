- "2 small white onions"
- "1 large poblano pepper"
- "3 lg Cloves of garlic"
- "2/3 cup corn or canola oil"
- "2/3 cup flour"
- "8 oz. Tomato sauce"
- "6 cups water"
- "2 tbl Spoon oregano"
- "2 beef bouillon"
- " Salt to your liking"
recipeinstructions:
- "Stem and deseed all your peppers. I wear latex disposable gloves for this if you don&#39;t make sure to wash your hands throughly and try not to rub your eyes."
- "Wash your peppers really well under cold water."
- "Add six cups of water or enough to cover all your peppers."
- "Add beef bouillon and bring to a boil. Stir and reduce heat to med/low and simmer for 1 1/2 hours or untill water almost cooks completely off."
- "Should look something like this about a cup and a half of liquid left. Remove from heat and let cool down a bit."

- "You can use a regular blender or a hand blender like I am using entirely up to you. Blend all your peppers untill smooth and consistent. After this some people push the mixture through a sieve to collect the little bits of skin and seeds if there are any but I personally by-pass this all together."
- "Now add your tomato sauce and charred vegetables in and continue to blend untill well incorporated."
- "Now in a pan large enough to hold all of your sauce. Preheat pan to med. heat and add your oil then slowly add your flour and stir for about 5-6 mins to make a light roux and cook the floury taste out."
- "Carefully add your pepper sauce in to your roux stirring all the time untill all is incorporated. Add your oregano and simmer for 20 mins."
- "Now taste and check for salt content add if desired but remember we used the beef bouillon witch in itself is quite salty."
- "Hope you all enjoy. Making chicken tamales today so look for that recipe soon. They are very time consuming but well worth all the effort."

<i>Before you jump to Red chile pepper sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be irritating. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Be smart when you do your grocery shopping. If you make smart choices when you are shopping for your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think for a second: you don't want to go to a busy grocery store or sit in a lengthy line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to get home immediately and have something good. Your kitchen should be filled with healthy foods and ingredients. This way—even if you pick out something a little greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still selecting foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. It is more about making your body as strong as it can be.
