<i>Before you jump to Kohlrabi and fennel salad - vegan recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is complete, most people do not wish to go to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Go up the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isnâ€™t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even just a individual flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Don't forget that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need to make your body as strong it can be.
