recipeingredient:
- " Corn on the cob"
- " Salt"
- " Water"
- " Note Cook as much corn as you like as long as they fit into the pan without overlapping"
recipeinstructions:
- "Shuck the corn and rinse."
- "Break the corn to fit into your saucepan."
- "Place the corn in the saucepan with a cup of water (only one). The key is not to immerse the corn entirely. Sprinkle in a tiny pinch of salt."
- "Cover with a lid. Cook over high for 3 minutes."
- "If desired, turn over the pieces, and boil for about 1 more minute. It&#39;s not necessary to cover the pot here. To drain, slide the lid to drain out the small amount of water remaining. No need to use a strainer."
- "Remove the lid, and the corn should be a beautiful, shiny golden yellow. Plate quickly and enjoy!"
- "That&#39;s all there is to it. This corn should be completely boiled to perfection. They are truly sweet and delicious prepared this way."
- "If you buy a large amount of corn-on-the-cob, boil them right away, double-wrap them in plastic wrap, then freeze to store. Corn is best in the summer, when it&#39;s in season. We like having ours with bread and soup, or topping it on pizza!"
- "I also posted how to fold a box for disposing vegetable scraps at the table. When you have spare time, fold them from the ad pages in your newspaper, and use them to toss edamame shells, corn scarps, etc."
- "I made my first corn-on-the-cob of the season."
- "If you have any leftovers, wrap them in aluminium foil, and store them in the refrigerator. After a few days, you can grill them in the foil on your grill or oven grill with soy sauce drizzled on top for a grilled corn-on-the-cob. The sweet aroma is delightful!"

<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can easily minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
