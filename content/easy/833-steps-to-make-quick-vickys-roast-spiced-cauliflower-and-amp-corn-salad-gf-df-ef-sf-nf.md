<i>Before you jump to Vickys Roast Spiced Cauliflower &amp; Corn Salad GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, more often than not.
