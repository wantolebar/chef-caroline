<i>Before you jump to Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that tough. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
