<i>Before you jump to Sauteed Mushrooms and Scallops recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Let's begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. Complete this for your house, not only the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently discover members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house as well. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that tough. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
