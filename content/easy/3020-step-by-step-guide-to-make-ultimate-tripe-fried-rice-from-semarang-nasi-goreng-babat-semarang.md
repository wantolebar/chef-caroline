You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise.

If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Go up the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? So many people choose the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get wholesome. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start.
