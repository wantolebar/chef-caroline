<i>Before you jump to Easy Moist Chocolate chip Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Start with replacing the bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen area. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more originally, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. Using these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than merely exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house at the same time. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty straightforward to live green, of course. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
