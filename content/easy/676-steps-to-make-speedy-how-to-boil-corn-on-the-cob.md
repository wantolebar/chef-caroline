recipeingredient:
- " Corn on the Cob"
- "2 tbsp Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Husk the corn and remove the threads. ※Husk it right before you boil it. Don&#39;t peel it off in the supermarket! The husk protects the corn."
- "Place the corn on the cob in a shallow pot and fill with water until just covered. Once it begins to boil, boil for 3 minutes."
- "While boiling, prepare the salt water. For 1 liter of water, use 2 tablespoons (30g) of salt. ※When you taste the water it should be pretty salty."
- "Place the boiled corn into the saltwater. (Quickly dip into the saltwater in order to cool the surfaces.) ※Be careful not to burn yourself!"
- "Drain the water and enjoy! If you&#39;re not going to eat them right away, wrap them in plastic wrap and keep in the refrigerator."
- "The top corn on the cob was boiled with the husk, and the bottom was boiled without. They really don&#39;t look much different. I can&#39;t even taste any difference. They&#39;re both delicious!"
- "They taste great when chilled during the summer!"

<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite straightforward to live green, after all. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
