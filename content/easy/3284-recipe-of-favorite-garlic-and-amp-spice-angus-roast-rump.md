recipeingredient:
- "1 34lb Angus beef rump"
- "3 clove garlic minced"
- "1/2 tbsp ground cumin"
- "1/2 tbsp onion powder"
- "1 ground cayenne to taste"
- "1 1/2 lb fingerling potatoes"
- "1 small yellow onion quartered"
- "4 carrots sliced"
- "1 salt to taste"
- "1 cracked black pepper to taste"
- "1 extra virgin olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°F. Toss vegetables in a bowl with olive oil, salt and black pepper. Place in roasting pan and cook for 30mins."
- "While the veggies roast, remove skin and fat (not all fat though!) From meat, and cut several long slices lengthwise. Mix spices and salt. Put garlic in each slice, reserving some for rubbing on the outside of the roast. Rub spice mixture and remaining garlic all over the roast. Place in oven and cook approx 1hr or until internal temp is 135°F. Remove from oven and let stand, covered in foil for 20 mins. The meat will continue to cook as it stands. Meanwhile, whip up a quick side dish or two. (I like sauteed mushrooms and Yorshire Pudding with my roasts.) You can also make a gravy or demiglaze with the pan drippings by adding a little water or wine, stirring and scraping well to get all the good burnt bits. Heat over medium flame until reduced by 1/2. Slice meat, serve and enjoy."

<i>Before you jump to Garlic &amp; Spice Angus Roast Rump recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Consider the stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are a good deal of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being clever when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Trying to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
