<i>Before you jump to Baked Whole Chicken Legs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as economically as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
