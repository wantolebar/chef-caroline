<i>Before you jump to Chicken liver recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
