<i>Before you jump to TL&#39;s Old Fashioned Salmon Croquettes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. Mostly, all it will take is a little common sense.
