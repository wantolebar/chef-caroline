Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
