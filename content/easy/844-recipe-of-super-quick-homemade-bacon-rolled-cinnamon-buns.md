<i>Before you jump to Bacon Rolled Cinnamon Buns recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
