<i>Before you jump to My TAKE on Green Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesnâ€™t have to be a chore. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? So many people choose the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also critical. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. It has more to do with making your body as strong as it can be.
