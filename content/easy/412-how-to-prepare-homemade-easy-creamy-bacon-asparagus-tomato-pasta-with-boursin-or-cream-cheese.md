recipeingredient:
- " pasta of choice boiled al dente and drained I used spaghetti this time"
- " olive oil"
- " bacon cut into 13 pieces"
- " asparagus woody part snapped off and cut into 15inch pieces"
- " fresh cherry or grape tomatoes halved OR 1 15 oz can diced tomatoes drained"
- " chopped fresh parsley OR 1 to 2 Tablespoons dried"
- " garlic finely chopped"
- " lemon juice"
- " Boursin any flavor or cream cheese"
- " salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large frying pan, bring 1/2 Tablespoon olive oil up to medium heat, add bacon to the pan, and render the bacon to your desired doneness. I like to render it about a third and still have some pork fat left on the bacon pieces."
- "Turn heat to high, add asparagus, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally."
- "Add another 1 Tablespoon of olive oil, add tomatoes, and cook the tomatoes for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Don&#39;t fear the high heat - the liquid and volume of the asparagus and tomatoes will keep things from burning."
- "Add garlic and three-quarters of the parsley, stir to incorporate, and cook until garlic is translucent."
- "Add pasta, lemon juice, and cheese, and stir or toss everything together. Give the cheese a minute or so to melt, stirring a couple of times in the process.   At this point, you&#39;ll want to salt to taste. I used about 1/2 teaspoon. Didn&#39;t need much because of the salt from the bacon and the cheese."
- "When the cheese is melted, give everything another gentle toss to make sure all the ingredients are incorporated, sprinkle the rest of the parsley on top, and enjoy! :)"

<i>Before you jump to Easy Creamy Bacon, Asparagus, Tomato Pasta with Boursin (or Cream Cheese) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthful.

Climb stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are many things you can pursue to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthy isnâ€™t just about slimming down. You need to help to make your body as strong it can be.
