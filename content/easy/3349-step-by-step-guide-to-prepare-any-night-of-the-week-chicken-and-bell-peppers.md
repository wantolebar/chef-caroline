<i>Before you jump to Chicken and Bell Peppers recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Let's begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen. You really need to change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than merely exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This also occurs in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
