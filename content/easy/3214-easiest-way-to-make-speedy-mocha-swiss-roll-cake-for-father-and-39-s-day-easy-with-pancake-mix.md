recipeingredient:
- " Sponge Cake"
- "60 grams Pancake mix"
- "4 Eggs"
- "50 grams Granulated sugar caster sugar"
- "2 tbsp Instant coffee"
- "2 tbsp Water"
- " Cream"
- "200 ml Heavy cream"
- "30 grams Granulated sugar caster sugar"
- "1/2 stick or more Vanilla beans or essence"
recipeinstructions:
- "Since there are not a lot of steps, preheat the oven to 200°C beforehand. Prepare the baking tray by lining with parchment paper and dust with flour (or you can use a sieve)."
- "Boil water and add to the instant coffee. Stir well to dissolve."
- "For this step, use a clean, dry bowl and a hand mixer. Add the egg and sugar to the bowl and heat it over a double boiler for 10 minutes while beating until it turns a white-ish color."
- "When the mixture becomes thick enough that it forms a thick ribbon when you lift the hand mixer, beat for 1 more minute. Lower the speed to low and gently mix to even out the mixture."
- "Add the pancake mix into Step 4 in a few batches, and mix after each addition. Add Step 2 and combine by scooping up from the bottom. It should be fine if you scoop about 50 times."
- "-If you don&#39;t mix it enough or mix it too roughly, it will become a dense batter. As seen in the photo, the goal is to mix it until there is a glaze. Scoop it up from the bottom uniformly."
- "Once completely mixed, pour into the baking tray and use a scraper to flatten out the surface. Tap the tray against the counter several times to get rid of the larger air pockets. Place in the preheated oven."
- "Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and check to see if it&#39;s done by inserting a skewer. If batter sticks to the skewer, bake it for a few more minutes."
- "Once baked, cover with plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out and let it cool. If you want to make a roll cake that does not have the browned surface, cover the browned surface with plastic wrap."
- "Add the granulated sugar to the heavy cream. Cut the vanilla bean in half and remove the beans. Add to the cream and whip. (You can also use vanilla essence.)"
- "If you are rolling the cake into a swirl pattern, whip the cream until fairly stiff peaks form. If you are rolling the cake in an O shape, beat the cream until stiff peaks form. If you&#39;re using cream that is high in butterfat, it will whip up quickly, so pay attention."
- "You can either roll the cake with the browned side on the outside or inside. If you want to remove the browned surface, gently peel off the plastic wrap and it should come off together. Angle the wrapping edge of the cake."
- "Place parchment paper under the spongecake and spread the cake with the cream. Place more cream on the half of the cake nearest you. Roll the cake. (Here is where you will add any fruit, etc.)"
- "Once rolled, let it sit for a while to fix the shape and cool. Cut off the ends and it&#39;s done. Once cooled, use a warmed knife to slice it neatly."
- "Decorate it however you want."

<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These types of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Start with replacing the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a small amount more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. You also have to obtain the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and discover just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
