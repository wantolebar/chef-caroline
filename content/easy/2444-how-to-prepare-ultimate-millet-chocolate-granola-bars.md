recipeingredient:
- " oats"
- " oats finely ground or 14 cup oat flour"
- " dried unsweetened shredded coconut"
- " millet flakes"
- " salt"
- " ground cinnamon optional"
- " about 140 grams chopped dried fruit"
- " chopped dark chocolate or chocolate chips"
- " peanut butter"
- " olive oil or coconut oil warmed until liquefied"
- " about 85 grams honey or golden syrup"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line an 8-by-8 inch square pan with two sheets of parchment paper, extending each up two sides, forming a “sling” for your bars to make them easy to remove."
- "In a large bowl, combine oats, oat flour or ground oats, coconut, millet, salt, cinnamon (if using), dried fruit and chocolate. In a separate, small bowl, whisk together peanut butter, oil and sweetener of choice until smooth."
- "Pour wet mixture into dry and stir until combined. Transfer to prepared pan, spreading until flat, then use an addition square of parchment paper to protect your hand as you press, press, pressthe ingredients tightly into all corners of the pan, until they can be pressed no flatter."
- "Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the tops are golden and the edges are light brown. Let cool completely before cutting; they’ll be even easier to cut without crumbling if you chill them in the fridge first, so feel free to cool them there."
- "Once cool, use the parchment “sling” to lift bars from pan and transfer to cutting board. Use a sharp, serrated knife in a very gentle sawing motion to cut bars into desired sizes (I usually go for 16 2×2-inch squares)."
- "Bars will keep at room temperature for up to a week in an airtight container"

<i>Before you jump to Millet Chocolate Granola Bars recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
