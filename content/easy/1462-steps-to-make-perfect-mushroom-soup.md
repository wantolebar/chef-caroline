<i>Before you jump to Mushroom soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These types of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that hard. A lot of it truly is simply utilizing common sense.
