<i>Before you jump to Leftover dum keema lasagna recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty straightforward to live green, after all. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
