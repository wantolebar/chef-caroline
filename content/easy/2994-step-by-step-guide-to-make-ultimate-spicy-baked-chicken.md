<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that difficult. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
