<i>Before you jump to Oreo chocolate ball recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
