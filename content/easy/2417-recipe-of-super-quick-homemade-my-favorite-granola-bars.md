recipeingredient:
- "1 1/2 cups quick oats"
- "1 cup crisp rice cereal"
- "1/4 cup ground flaxseed"
- "1/4 cup unsalted butter"
- "1/4 cup honey"
- "1/4 cup brown sugar"
- "pinch salt"
- "1/4 cup pepitas also known as pumpkin seeds"
- "1/4 cup almonds roughly chopped could also used sliced"
- "1/4 cup craisins or raisins or other dried fruit"
- "1/4 cup shredded coconut could also use coconut chips or a mix"
recipeinstructions:
- "Optional first step : lay out the oats on a baking tray and bake at 350°F for 10 or so minutes, until everything is toasted and golden. Keep a close eye on them though, as the oats can burn quickly. Toasting the oats beforehand just adds a nice flavor to the finished bars, but this step isn&#39;t necessary."
- "Line a 8x8&#34;or a 9x9&#34; pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to easily lift the finished bars out and set aside."
- "Toss the oats, rice cereal and ground flaxseed together in a large bowl. Set aside."
- "In a medium saucepan, start heating your butter over medium heat. Once it begins to melt, whisk in the brown sugar, honey and pinch of salt. This will form a kind of sticky caramel sauce, which will be the glue that holds the bars together. Let this come to simmer, then remove from heat."
- "Pour the sauce over the ingredients in the bowl and use a rubber spatula to mix it all in. Make sure everything is fully saturated. Then fold in the rest of the ingredients. If using chocolate chips as one of your ingredients, barely fold them in after everything else is fully mixed, that way they won&#39;t melt from the initial heat of the sauce."
- "Pour this mix into the prepared baking pan and use either a spatula or another pan or your hands to press down on the granola mixture very firmly. Whatever you&#39;re using to press down the granola, spray it first with non-stick cooking spray. Its important to really pack it down hard or you&#39;ll end up with crumbly granola chunks instead of bars."
- "Place the pan into the fridge for at least 2 hours. Then, remove the granola from the pan using the parchment paper. Use a large, sharp knife to cut it into bars (or squares)."
- "That&#39;s it! For grab and go convenience, you can individually wrap these using parchment paper and string or you can wrap them in plastic wrap. Store them for up to 1 week. They&#39;re a bit hard and crunchy straight out of the fridge, so I&#39;d recommend letting them sit out at room temperature for a few minutes before eating."

<i>Before you jump to My Favorite Granola Bars recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthful.

Drink water, not alternative beverages. Soda and coffee, when consumed in moderation, aren't that bad. It will be, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. Having water instead of other kinds of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Water is often the main element to successful weight-loss and healthfulness.

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
