<i>Before you jump to Garlic Parmesan Hasselback Potatoes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Start with replacing the bulbs. Complete this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. You need to upgrade your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The kitchen lights in particular will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, after all. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
