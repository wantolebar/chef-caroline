<i>Before you jump to Heathers Stuffed Shells recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Start out with changing the lights. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them rather than incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. Along with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll usually discover members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house as well. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
