<i>Before you jump to Market Salsa recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
