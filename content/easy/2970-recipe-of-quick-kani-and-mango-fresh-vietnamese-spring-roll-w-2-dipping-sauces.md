<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. Largely, all it requires is a little common sense.
