<i>Before you jump to Salt Baked Crab # recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good a place to start as any. Accomplish this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them in place of incandescent lights. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Using these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than simply swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and see how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that hard. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
