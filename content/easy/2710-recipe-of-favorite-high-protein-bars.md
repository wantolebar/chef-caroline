<i>Before you jump to High protein bars recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. When you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
