<i>Before you jump to Fried Green Tomatoes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as economically as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
