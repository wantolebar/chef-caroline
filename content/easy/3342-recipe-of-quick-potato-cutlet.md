<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Perhaps the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, nevertheless it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
