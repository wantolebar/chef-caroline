<i>Before you jump to pan-fry fish with sauteed mushroom recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Start out with changing the bulbs. Complete this for your house, not only the kitchen. You should replace your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house as well. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. It's about being functional, most of the time.
