<i>Before you jump to Sweet Potato Chaat recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as economically as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
