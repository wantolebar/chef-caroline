<i>Before you jump to Cauliflower &amp; Fennel Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not that difficult. A lot of it is basically making use of common sense.
