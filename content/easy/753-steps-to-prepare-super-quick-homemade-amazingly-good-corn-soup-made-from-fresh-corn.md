recipeinstructions:
- "Make cuts in each corn cob as shown in between the rows of kernels. Make cuts between each row of kernels on both cobs."
- "Scrape one of the corn cobs with the back side of a kitchen knife to remove the insides of the corn only, leaving the skins. Remove the whole kernels with the blade of the knife from the other cob."
- "This is what was removed from the corn cobs.  Finely chop the onions and saute in butter over low heat until transparent, then add the corn and continue sauteeing."
- "When the corn is cooked through and turns a nice yellow in color it&#39;s done.  You can freeze half of this mixture in a ziplock bag. We&#39;ll make the rest into soup."

- "Make the beurre manié (literally, &#34;kneaded&#34; butter). Put the butter (1 tablespoon) into a heatproof container and melt in the microwave. Add the flour and mix well."
- "Add the beurre manié to the pan little by little to thicken the soup. Add the rest of the milk and the heavy cream, and adjust the thickness."
- "When the soup is the constency you like, season with salt and pepper to taste and it&#39;s done."
- "If you reduce the amount of milk drastically, the soup will be thick even without added thickener. If you want a really rich version!"
- "The corn and onion add a lot of sweetness, so this tastes best if you are generous with the salt. If you find the flavor lacking, add a tiny bit of soup stock granules."
