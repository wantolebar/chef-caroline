<i>Before you jump to Bombay style pav bhaji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

The kitchen alone offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
