recipeingredient:
- "1/2 Onion"
- "200 ml Storebought tempura flour"
- "200 ml Beer"
- "1 tsp Grainy mustard try cassis mustard if you have"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "1 Frying oil"
- "1 dash each Salt pepper garlic powder for seasoning the chicken"

- "1 1/2 tbsp Mayonnaise"
- "1 dash Lemon juice"
- "1 Wasabi"
- "20 Fava beans shells removed"
- "2 Chicken tenders sinews removed"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the thin membrane from the fava beans. Cut the each chicken tender diagonally into 5 pieces, and lightly season with salt, pepper and garlic powder (optional). Slice the onion into rounds to make onion rings."
- "Put 1 cup of store-bought tempura flour into a bowl, pour the beer, add salt and grain mustard, and mix well. Deep-fry the battered onion, fava beans, and chicken tenders in that order in 170℃ oil. (Since the chicken tenders are seasoned with garlic powder, deep-fry at the end, so that the other things won&#39;t absorb the smell)."
- "Cut 1/2 of avocado into small pieces, sprinkle with lemon juice, and mix with mayonnaise. Pass the mixture through a strainer, and add wasabi little by little to make your desired spiciness. Mix well after each addition. Serve the beer-battered fries with this dip."
- "For grainy mustard, if you find cassis mustard, it&#39;s worth trying it to make this dip! It&#39;s grainy mustard with the cassis aroma (not sweet), and has a refreshing flavor. You can use the leftover to make a salad dressing or sandwich, or serve with meat dishes."

<i>Before you jump to Beer-Battered Fried Fava Beans and Chicken Tenders recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Let's begin with something not that hard, changing the actual light bulbs. This will probably go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. You need to upgrade your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. You also have to obtain the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and discover exactly how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. It's about being practical, usually.
