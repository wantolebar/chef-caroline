<i>Before you jump to My Garlic Hot Wings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
