recipeinstructions:
- "Make the stollen dough. Knead all of the ingredients together aside from the butter, fruit, and nuts. (This is a stiff dough)."
- "Add softened butter to the dough in 3~4 batches and knead it in. It is done once it stretches well and you can vaguely see your fingers when you stretch out the dough."
- "Add the dried fruits and nuts after mixing in all of the butter, and knead until they are evenly distributed in the dough. Roll into a ball."
- "Tip: I use a commercial stollen dried fruit mix mostly. If using homemade sugared citrus peels or rum raisin, make sure to pat them dry before using."
- "Wrap in plastic wrap, and let the dough rise to about twice the size. (It takes about 2 hours at room temperature)."
- "Roll out the dough on a surface covered in flour, divide into 6 equal portions, and roll out to 18 x 10 cm with a rolling pin. Divide the marzipan into 6 portions, roll into logs and place it 1/3 on the dough."
- "Spread the marzipan into the fold of the dough, and press the sides together firmly so it won&#39;t open up."
- "Proof the dough at 30 °C for 20~25 minutes to lightly ferment, and then bake in an oven preheated to 200 °C for 35~40 minutes. Melt butter for the finishing touch while it is baking."
- "Coat the entire surface with lots of the melted butter to let it sink into the dough."
- "Coat  the entire surface with granulated sugar, sprinkle lots of powdered sugar on the bottom and top, and it is done. Wrap in plastic wrap to store."
- "To make raw marzipan (Marzipanrohmasse) from scratch, mix 90g almonds, 90g sugar, and 20g egg together well, gather into one lump. Refrigerate overnight before using."
