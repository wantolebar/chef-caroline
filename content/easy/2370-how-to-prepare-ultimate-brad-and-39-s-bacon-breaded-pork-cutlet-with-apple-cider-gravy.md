<i>Before you jump to Brad&#39;s bacon breaded pork cutlet with apple cider gravy recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is commenced. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
