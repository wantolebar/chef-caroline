Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as economically as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F.
