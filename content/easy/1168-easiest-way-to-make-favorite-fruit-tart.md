The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the particular light bulbs. This will probably go beyond the kitchen, nonetheless that is okay. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a little bit more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed.
