It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is definitely not true. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
