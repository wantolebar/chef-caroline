recipeingredient:
- "1 kg Soy beans"
- "1 kg Koji dried or fresh"
- "500 grams Salt"
- "2 Red chili peppers optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the soy beans, then soak them in plenty of water overnight (for a 24 hour period). The soy beans will triple in size from rehydrating, so be sure to use a large pot."
- "Here is what they should look like after soaking. Depending on the soy bean, scum may appear, but without removing the scum, set the pot to boil (do not refresh the water)."
- "Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to the lowest setting. Skim the scum and simmer until the soy beans can be slightly crushed between your fingers (this should take anywhere from 3 to 8 hours)."
- "This is how it should look after skimming off the scum from the surface. Do not bother to remove it too carefully; just skim enough to remove the majority of it."
- "Test by crushing a soy bean between your fingers, and if it can be slightly crushed, turn off the heat, cover with a lid, then let sit overnight."
- "Return the pot to heat and simmer for about 30 minutes over low heat. They are now ready to be turned into miso."
- "Prepare the necessary ingredients and equipment: 2 bowls or pots, a 10-liter pickling tub, 2 large food-grade plastic bags, and a potato masher."
- "While simmering the soy beans, break up the koji into small pieces, then combine with the salt."
- "Line the pickling tub with a double layer of the food-grade plastic bags."
- "Mash the soy beans (to your desired consistency) with a potato masher while still hot . Do not discard the boiling water from the soy beans."
- "This is what the soy beans look like after they are mashed (I mashed them to a miso-like consistency). For easy mashing, use a meat grinder, if available."
- "Once the soy beans have cooled to the touch, mix in the koji. Then, mix in the boiling water from the soy beans until the consistency resembles miso paste."
- "Pack the miso into patties, as though making hamburger patties, while pressing out any air pockets."
- "Slam the miso patties into the tub as hard as you can, and after several handfuls, press out the air and level the surface, then repeat."
- "Level the surface while pressing out the air, and very lightly sprinkle with salt."
- "To the extent possible, press the excess air from the inner bag and tie it closed with string."
- "Place a drop lid on top, then weigh the miso down with a weight equivalent to the weight of the beans. If you don&#39;t have a weight, use a bag of salt. The key is to press down on the miso with substantial weight."
- "Press out any air, and secure the outer plastic bag with a string. If you have red chili peppers, place them inside the outer bag to inhibit mold growth. You could also use shichimi (7 season chili spice mix) spice."
- "Cover the outside of the bucket to prevent dust from entering. Store it in a cool, unheated environment. Every 2 months, stir it up, and taste until it reaches the desired degree of fermentation."

<i>Before you jump to Authentic Homemade Miso recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. When our work day is complete, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Make smart choices when grocery shopping. Making good decisions when obtaining groceries means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. At the end of your day do you really want to deal with packed grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to go to your house and make a little something from your kitchen. Your home should be stocked with healthy foods and ingredients. This way—even if you decide on something slightly greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still selecting foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about losing weight. You need to make your body as strong it can be.

1. Rinse the soy beans, then soak them in plenty of water overnight (for a 24 hour period). The soy beans will triple in size from rehydrating, so be sure to use a large pot.
1. Here is what they should look like after soaking. Depending on the soy bean, scum may appear, but without removing the scum, set the pot to boil (do not refresh the water).
1. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to the lowest setting. Skim the scum and simmer until the soy beans can be slightly crushed between your fingers (this should take anywhere from 3 to 8 hours).
1. This is how it should look after skimming off the scum from the surface. Do not bother to remove it too carefully; just skim enough to remove the majority of it.
1. Test by crushing a soy bean between your fingers, and if it can be slightly crushed, turn off the heat, cover with a lid, then let sit overnight.

1. Prepare the necessary ingredients and equipment: 2 bowls or pots, a 10-liter pickling tub, 2 large food-grade plastic bags, and a potato masher.
1. While simmering the soy beans, break up the koji into small pieces, then combine with the salt.
1. Line the pickling tub with a double layer of the food-grade plastic bags.
1. Mash the soy beans (to your desired consistency) with a potato masher while still hot . Do not discard the boiling water from the soy beans.
1. This is what the soy beans look like after they are mashed (I mashed them to a miso-like consistency). For easy mashing, use a meat grinder, if available.
