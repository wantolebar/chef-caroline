recipeingredient:
- " Topping"
- "1/4 cup sugar"
- "1 1/2 tsp lemon zest"
- "1/2 cup almond slices"
- " Cake"
- "2 1/4 cup all purpose flour"
- "1 1/8 tsp baking powder"
- "1 1/8 tsp baking soda"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "10 tbsp unsalted butter softened but still cool"
- "1 1/8 cup sugar"
- "5 tbsp sugar"
- "1 tbsp lemon zest"
- "4 tsp lemon juice"
- "4 large eggs"
- "5 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 1/4 cup sour cream"
- "8 oz cream cheese softened"
recipeinstructions:
- "FOR THE TOPPING: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350°. Spray 10-inch tube pan with vegetable oil spray. Stir sugar and lemon zest in small bowl until combined and sugar is moistened. Stir in almonds; set aside."
- "FOR THE CAKE: Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl; set aside. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter, 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, and lemon zest on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, and beat until combined. Add 4 teaspoons vanilla and mix to combine. Reduce speed to low and add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with 2 additions of sour cream, scraping down bowl as needed. Give batter final stir by hand."
- "Reserve 1 1/4 cups batter and set aside. Spoon remaining batter into prepared pan and smooth top. Return now-empty bowl to mixer and beat cream cheese, remaining 5 tablespoons sugar, lemon juice, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla on medium speed until smooth and slightly lightened, about 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup reserved batter and mix until incorporated. Spoon cream cheese mixture evenly over batter, keeping filling about 1 inch from edges of pan; smooth top. Spread remaining 1 cup reserved batter over filling and smooth top. With butter knife or offset spatula, gently swirl filling into batter using figure-eight motion, being careful to not drag filling to bottom or edges of pan. Firmly tap pan on counter 2 or 3 times to dislodge any bubbles. Sprinkle sugar topping evenly over batter and gently press into batter to adhere."
- "Bake until top is golden and just firm, and skewer inserted in cake comes out clean (skewer will be wet if inserted in cream cheese filling), 45 to 50 minutes. Remove pan from oven and firmly tap on counter 2 or 3 times (top of cake may sink slightly). Let cake cool in pan on wire rack for 1 hour. Gently invert cake onto rimmed baking sheet (cake will be topping side down); remove tube pan, place wire rack on top of cake, and invert cake sugar side up. Let cool to room temperature, about 1 1/2 hours, before serving."

<i>Before you jump to Lemon Cream Cheese Almond Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's about being functional, most of the time.
