<i>Before you jump to Homemade cheap protein shake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
