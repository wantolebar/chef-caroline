<i>Before you jump to Avocado Toasted Breakfast Sandwich recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle demands. When our work day is finished, most people do not want to go to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Run the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? Most people will decide to be idle and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done each day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Remember: being healthy and balanced isnâ€™t just about slimming down. It is more about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
