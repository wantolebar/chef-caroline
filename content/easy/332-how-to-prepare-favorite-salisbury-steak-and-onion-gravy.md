<i>Before you jump to Salisbury steak and onion gravy recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
