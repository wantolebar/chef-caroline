<i>Before you jump to Brenda&#39;s Pasties recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that hard. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
