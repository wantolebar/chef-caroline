<i>Before you jump to Creamy Prawn &amp; Olive Pasta recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These kinds of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that tough. Typically, all it requires is a little common sense.
