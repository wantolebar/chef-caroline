<i>Before you jump to Garlic Butter and Herb Oven Roasted Chicken and Vegetables recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many men and women wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
