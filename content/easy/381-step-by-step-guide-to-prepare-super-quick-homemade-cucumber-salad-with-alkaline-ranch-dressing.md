<i>Before you jump to Cucumber salad with alkaline ranch dressing recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the conclusion of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Consider the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an attempt on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. It’s about making your body as strong as it can be.
