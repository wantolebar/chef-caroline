recipeingredient:
- " Pancake Batter "
- "2 eggs"
- "1 cup milk"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 cup all purpose flour"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- " Filling "
- "2 apples peeled pitted and choppedsliced"
- "2-1/2 tbs butter"
- "1/2 tsp cinnamon powder"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "1/3 cup brown sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, make the filling.  Melt the butter over medium heat, add the peaches, cinnamon and salt. Cook about 6-7 minutes. Add brown sugar and cook another 3-4 minutes."
- "Beat eggs, milk and vanilla extract with a hand whisker just until well blended. Sift the flour and salt. Gradually add the wet mixture onto the flour. Mix well until just combined. Don&#39;t overmix the batter, that&#39;s why you must sift the dry ingredients before adding them to the wet ingredients so you would be able to mix properly throughout the batter."
- "Grease with butter a 9 inch or 10 inch round/square pan (use a shallow pan, not more than 2 inches deep). Pour the filling into the pan (add butter cubes over the filling if you like) then pour the batter over it. Place the pan in a COLD OVEN. Bake at 450°F. Do not open the oven door while cooking the pancake. It will puff up and become crisp around the edges."
- "Bake for 15 to 17 minutes until the pancake is puffed up and slightly browned.  Remove the pan from the oven and serve immediately."

<i>Before you jump to German/Dutch Baby Pancake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is done, most people do not wish to go to the gym. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a chore. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Drink water, not other drinks. Drinking a soda or cup of coffee every so often won't hurt you too badly. Using them for your lone source of hydration, conversely, is dumb. When you choose water over other beverages you are helping your body stay very healthful and hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories out of your diet— without having to be forced to eat terrible tasting diet food. Water is usually one of the keys to really slimming down and leading a healthful lifestyle.

There are many things you can pursue to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about slimming down. You need to help to make your body as strong it can be.
