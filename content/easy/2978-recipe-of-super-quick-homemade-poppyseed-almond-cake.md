<i>Before you jump to Poppyseed Almond Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. It's about being sensible, more often than not.
