Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. Particularly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.
