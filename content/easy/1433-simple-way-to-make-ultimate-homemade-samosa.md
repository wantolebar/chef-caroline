- "First heat the oil in a pan and deep fry the samosas on low heat. Alternatively, you can preheat the oven and then bake the samosas at 180 degrees Celcius for 40 minutes. Stir them occasionally, and fry on low heat for at least 15 minutes."
- "Once the potato samosa is golden and crisp, take it out on the kitchen paper. Finally, enjoy potato samosas with green chutney and tamarind chutney."

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Samosa recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Cash</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
