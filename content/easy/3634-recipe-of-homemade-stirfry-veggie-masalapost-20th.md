<i>Before you jump to # Stirfry veggie masala#post 20th recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
