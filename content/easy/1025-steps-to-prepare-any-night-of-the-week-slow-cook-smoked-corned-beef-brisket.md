recipeinstructions:

- "Soak wood chips, I prefer mesquite, for about 2 hours prior to the cook. Turn on the far left burner and get the grill temp to 220 to 250 degrees. Take the spices and mix together to create the rub. Make sure the meat is dry, then work the rub all over the meat."

Now, you can either place the meat 3rd and 4th burners rack, which are off and place a pan under the grate to catch any of the drippings. I always place the meat in a pan, so I have the juice of the meat to use as a gravy or injection if needed"

<i>Before you jump to Slow Cook Smoked Corned Beef Brisket recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Water is the best drinks out there. Drinking a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. Getting all your hydration from them is a awful idea. Ingesting water instead of other types of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. This also helps you lower your caloric intake by hundreds of points without needing to buy and eat gross diet foods. Water is usually one of the keys to really slimming down and leading a healthful lifestyle.

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Trying to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. You need your body to be powerful too.
