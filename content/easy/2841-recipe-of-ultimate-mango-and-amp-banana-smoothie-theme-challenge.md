It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.
