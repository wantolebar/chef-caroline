Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes.

The appropriate temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that hard. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
