- "3/4 cup parmesan cheese shredded"
- "3/4 cup mozzarella cheese shredded"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a tbsp. of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once it&#39;s hot, add the onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion has softened, about 5-7 minutes. Then stir in the garlic and cook and stir until it&#39;s fragrant, just another minute or so. Then add the tomato sauce, sugar and seasonings. Stir and allow it to come to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce the heat to med-low and let it gently simmer while you prepare everything else."
- "Start a large pot of salted water heating on high heat. Once it reaches a boil, add in the shells. Cook for 1 minute less than the time called for on the box, they will be easier to stuff this way. Once they are done, drain in a colander and immediately rinse them with cold water. This will stop the cooking process, so that they don&#39;t get any softer. Set them aside."
- "In a large skillet, heat the tbsp. of olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook just until fragrant, just about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Then add in the spinach and stir around slightly. Cook until it has all wilted and reduced, about 3-5 minutes. Remove from heat. drain out any water that may have been released from the spinach, then set aside on a cutting board and allow to cool enough to handle."
- "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the ricotta cheese and eggs until blended together. Next whisk in the seasonings, and about 1/4 cup of each of the cheeses. By now, the spinach should be cool enough to handle. Chop it up and stir it into the ricotta mixture."
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x13&#34; baking pan and spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce evenly over the bottom of the pan. Then, working one at a time, stuff each shell with 1 heaping tbsp. of the ricotta mixture, until all of the mixture is gone. Place each stuffed shell side by side into the pan, opening side up. Pour the remaining tomato sauce over the top of the shells, then spread over the remaining cheeses."
- "Cover the baking pan with foil and bake 15 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake an additional 15-20 minutes, until completely heated through. Serve immediately. Refrigerate any leftovers."

<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. You should change your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a small amount more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. You also have to obtain the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house as well. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and discover how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
