<i>Before you jump to Roasted Tomatillo and Garlic Salsa recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Climb stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a whole lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about losing weight. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
