<i>Before you jump to Brad&#39;s corned beef hash recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is finished, most people do not want to go to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

Consider the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are a whole lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. Little things, when done every single day, can do plenty to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It’s about making your body as powerful as it can be.
