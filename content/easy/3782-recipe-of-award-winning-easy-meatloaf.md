<i>Before you jump to Easy Meatloaf recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. It's related to being functional, more often than not.
