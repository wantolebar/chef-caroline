<i>Before you jump to Mushroom &amp; Bell Pepper Breakfast Burritos recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. It's about being functional, more often than not.
