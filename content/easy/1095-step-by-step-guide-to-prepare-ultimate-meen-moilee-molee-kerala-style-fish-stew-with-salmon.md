<i>Before you jump to Meen Moilee/Molee - Kerala style fish stew with Salmon recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a chore. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are many things you can go after to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
