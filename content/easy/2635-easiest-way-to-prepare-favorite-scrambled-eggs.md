Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as effectively as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less frequently, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
