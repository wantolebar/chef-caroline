<i>Before you jump to Beef Brisket Rub recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Start with changing the lights. Do this for the entire house, not merely the kitchen. You need to upgrade your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This likewise happens in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not that tough. It's about being practical, most of the time.
