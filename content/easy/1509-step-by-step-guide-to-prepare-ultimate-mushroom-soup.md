Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as efficiently as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to operate as often.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
