<i>Before you jump to Nan&#39;s Broccoli Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. It's about being practical, more often than not.
