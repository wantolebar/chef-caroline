That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. A lot of it really is basically making use of common sense.
