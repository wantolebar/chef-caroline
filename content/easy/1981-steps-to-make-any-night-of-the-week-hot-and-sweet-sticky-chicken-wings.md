Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can easily minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite straightforward to live green, after all. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
