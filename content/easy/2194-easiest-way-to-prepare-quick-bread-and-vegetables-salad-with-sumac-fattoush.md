These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. You also have to acquire the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The kitchen lights especially will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. A lot of it truly is basically using common sense.
