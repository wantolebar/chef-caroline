Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not really that hard. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
