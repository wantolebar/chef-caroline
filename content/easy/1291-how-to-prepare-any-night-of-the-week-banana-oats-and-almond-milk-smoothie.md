recipeingredient:
- "2 tbsp. rolled oats"

- "1 tbsp. almond butter"
- "1 tbsp. chia seeds soaked in 4 tbsp water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Freeze bananas when they start going black, peel them and wrap well in cling film. There’s no need to chop them before freezing as they’ll slice easily, chunks might just shoot out from under the knife a bit!"
