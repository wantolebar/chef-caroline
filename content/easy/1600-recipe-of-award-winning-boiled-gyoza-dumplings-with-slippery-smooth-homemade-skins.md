recipeinstructions:
- "Put the ground pork and all the filling ingredients in a bowl and mix well."
- "Add the chicken soup and mix well. Leave the filling like this for 10 minutes, to let the ground pork absorb lots of soup."
- "Chop up the leek and cabbage fairly roughly. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt (not listed in the ingredients) and leave for 10 minutes. Tightly squeeze out the moisture."
- "Combine the Step 2 meat mixture, finely chopped garlic and ginger, the Step 3 cabbage, and leek."
- "Mix well, put into a container with a tightly sealing lid, and let it sit for a while in the refrigerator."
- "While the filling is resting, make the skins. Combine the bread and cake flours. Dissolve the salt in the boiling water, and add this to the flour mixture in 3 batches while mixing well."
- "When the dough comes together in one ball, place it on a work surface and knead well, while putting your weight into it. Wrap in plastic and rest for 20 minutes at room temperature."

- "If you don&#39;t flour the dough generously, the pieces will get stuck to each other. The thickness is more important than the shape of the skins."
- "Fill and form the dumplings. Put a generous amount of filling on each skin and then remove any excess. This way, the edge of the skin will be moistened so there&#39;s no need to put water on it."
- "Put the filled dumplings on a shallow tray."
- "Bring plenty of water to a boil in a wok, and add the gyoza dumplings. They are liable to stick to the bottom of the wok right after they&#39;re added, so stir them up gently with a ladle."
- "When the dumplings float to the surface they are done. Transfer them to servings plates, and serve with the special sauce or ponzu sauce, and cold beer!"

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is not true. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
