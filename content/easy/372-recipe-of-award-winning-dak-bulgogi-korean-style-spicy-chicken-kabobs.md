recipeingredient:
- "12-15 bamboo skewers soaked in water for at least an hour"
- "2-2.5 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into roughly 15inch cubes to the extent that you can cut chicken thigh meat into cubes which is to say not really"
- "2 Tablespoons minced garlic about 3 cloves"
- "1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root or you could use about 14 teaspoon dry ginger powder"
- "1 green onion finely chopped"
- "1/8 cup sugar"
- "1/8 cup gochujang Korean red chili paste You can substitute with sriracha  not quite the same but youll get a tasty result"
- "1/8 cup low sodium soy sauce"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1.5 Tablespoons neutral oil like vegetable canola grapeseed"
- "1 large onion cut into 1 pieces for skewering and tossed with 2 teaspoonfuls of oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, mix together all the ingredients except the onion, making sure to incorporate all of them thoroughly."
- "Cover the bowl and set in the fridge to marinate (about 1 hour ideally, and not more than 2). Remember to take the meat out of the fridge about 30 minutes before you&#39;re ready to grill.  If you&#39;re using a charcoal grill, start your coals about 20 to 25 minutes before you want to grill. You want a gentle, medium low heat over which to cook these kebabs.  If gas, just pre-heat your grill to medium low 5 to 7 minutes before cooking."
- "Skewer your kabobs so they look like this.  6 single layers of onion with 5 roughly 1&#34;layers of chicken skewered between them. As you&#39;ve probably discovered by now, it&#39;s a little challenging to get 1&#34; cubes of meat from chicken thighs, but you generally want a 1&#34; thickness of meat between veg, so you might have to add odd pieces of chicken to the bigger ones to achieve this thickness.  I used only onions mostly because I think it tastes simple and delicious this way."
- "Over a medium low grill, cook the kebabs about 15 minutes, covered, turning them every 5 minutes."
- "Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Dak Bulgogi (Korean Style Spicy Chicken) Kabobs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the conclusion of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Climb stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are many things you can pursue to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done each day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Don't ignore that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
