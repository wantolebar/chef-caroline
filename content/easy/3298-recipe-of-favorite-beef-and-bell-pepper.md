<i>Before you jump to Beef and Bell Pepper recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good an area to begin with as any. This will probably go outside of the kitchen, nonetheless that is okay. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent style, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a little bit more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see just how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
