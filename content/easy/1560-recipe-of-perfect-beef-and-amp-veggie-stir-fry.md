Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that tough. A lot of it is merely making use of common sense.
