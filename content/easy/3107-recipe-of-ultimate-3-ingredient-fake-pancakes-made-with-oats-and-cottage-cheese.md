<i>Before you jump to 3 ingredient fake pancakes (made with oats and cottage cheese) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and perhaps this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that hard. It's about being sensible, usually.
