<i>Before you jump to Chocolate decadent cake (no oven, no butter &amp; no condensed milk) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
