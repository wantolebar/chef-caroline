It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that tough. Mostly, all it will take is a little common sense.
