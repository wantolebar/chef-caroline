- " Chicken bones"
recipeinstructions:
- "I save all my bones leftover from meals, in a Ziplock bag in the freezer.*"
- "Put your bones in the Crock-Pot. Fill to the top with water. On low, leave over night. If muscles won&#39;t release from bones, turn crockpot to high for 3 - 5 hours. Til bones can be completely cleaned"
- "Let bones completely dry for a day or 2."
- "Clean everything that isn&#39;t bone off. Lay in one layer on a baking sheet. Oven on 450°. Bake for 30 minutes to start. Remove a bone with a towel, see if you can break it. Remove smaller bones and put the rest in for another 5-10 mins. Keep an eye so nothing burns."
- "Let bones cool. Break balls off the ends. They won&#39;t grind. *I put them in my compost or straight in the soil to slow release.* Put small shards in a coffee grinder. Grind til it&#39;s a fine powder. *A mortal and pestle also works well*"
- "For thicker bones, like beef pipe bones used for my Homemade Bone Broth recipe. Flip them in the oven every 30 minutes until they crack. These are more difficult to break to small pieces, I use a sledge hammer and a metal bucket. Then grind them in a coffee grinder. Before you bake dehydrate them, clean bones completely of meat, fat, or gristle. I give them to my dogs, then find them around the yard. Also, large chunks will release slower and can be put directly in the soil.*"

<i>Before you jump to Diy Bone Meal for plants + Bone Broth for pets recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is done, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Drink water, not alternative drinks. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every now and then isn’t a horrible idea. Using them for your only source of hydration, on the other hand, is dumb. Choosing water instead of other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Effective weight loss efforts often depend entirely on water ingestion.

There are a whole lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. It’s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
