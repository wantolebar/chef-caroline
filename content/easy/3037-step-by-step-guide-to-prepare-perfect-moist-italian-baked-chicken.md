<i>Before you jump to Moist Italian Baked Chicken! recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Although it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, after all. It's about being functional, more often than not.
