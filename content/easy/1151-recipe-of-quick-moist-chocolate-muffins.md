<i>Before you jump to Moist Chocolate Muffins recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Go up the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your lifestyle choices. You want your body to be strong too.
