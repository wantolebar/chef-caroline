Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good an area get started on as any. This will certainly go beyond the kitchen, nonetheless that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you will need to use them rather than incandescent lights. They cost a little bit more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Using these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Along with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Obviously this also happens in some other rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that hard. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
