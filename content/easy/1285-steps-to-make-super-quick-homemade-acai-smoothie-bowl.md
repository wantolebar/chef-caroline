<i>Before you jump to Acai smoothie bowl recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Although it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
