<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s Cold Alaskan King Crab Cheese Bagel Spread recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as economically as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
