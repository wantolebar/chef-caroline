Changing light bulbs is actually as good an area to begin with as any. Accomplish this for the entire house, not merely the kitchen. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Along with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed.
