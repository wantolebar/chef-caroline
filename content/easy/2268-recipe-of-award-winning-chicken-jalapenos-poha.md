<i>Before you jump to Chicken Jalapenos Poha recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, usually.
