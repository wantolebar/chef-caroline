<i>Before you jump to Rainbow Fruit Tart recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's about being practical, most of the time.
