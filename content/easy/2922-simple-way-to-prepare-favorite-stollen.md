<i>Before you jump to Stollen recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good a place get started on as any. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. You really need to change your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Of course this also happens in different rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that tough. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
