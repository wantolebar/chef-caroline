<i>Before you jump to Thai Punang Curry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
