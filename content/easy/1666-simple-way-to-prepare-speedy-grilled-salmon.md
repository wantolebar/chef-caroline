<i>Before you jump to Grilled Salmon recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Let's begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that tough. It's about being functional, most of the time.
