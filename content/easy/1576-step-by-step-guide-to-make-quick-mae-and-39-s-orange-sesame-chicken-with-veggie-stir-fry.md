<i>Before you jump to Mae&#39;s  Orange Sesame Chicken with Veggie Stir Fry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Start out with changing the lights. Do this for the entire house, not merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than simply replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Certainly this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. It's about being functional, usually.
