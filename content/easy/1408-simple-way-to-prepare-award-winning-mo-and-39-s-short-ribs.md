recipeingredient:
- "4 Beef Short Ribs"
- "2 Shallots thinly chopped"
- "1 Carrot cut in think round slices"
- "1 Celery stalk thin cut"
- "2 Garlic cloves peeled and smashed with the side of a chef knife"
- "5 leaves fresh Sagen enchiffonade cut"
- "2 sprigs fresh Thyme"
- "6 oz. Cabernet Sauvignon Wine or Merlot"
- "1 Cup Beef or chicken broth if homemade"
- "2 Tsp Hungarian Paprika"
- "1 TBSP Worcestershire sauce"
- "to taste SaltPepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "First let me clarify: I said homemade chicken or beef broth because the broth they sell ready are often full of....well, stuff you shouldn&#39;t eat. If you don&#39;t have homemade broth, then just melt 1 beef bouillon in 2 cups of boiling water and use as needed."
- "I assume you have done all the prep, so you have the ingredients chopped and ready to go. Rinse the ribs under warm water, pat dry and sprinkle with salt, fresh ground pepper, and the paprika on both sides."
- "In a large pot, heat a little vegetable oil, about 2 tbsp; use high heat, we want to sear the ribs so they retain the juices. Drop the ribs in there and a few minutes per side should be enough, you wanted to brown. Remove, set aside and cover with a plate."
- "In the same pan, you need to add some vegetable oil, heat it, and - still at medium-high heat add the carrots. After 3 minutes add shallots, celery, and garlic and cook about 5 minutes."
- "Now add the ribs to the pan, the herbs, the Worcestershire sauce, and the half of the wine.  Cover the pot and cook 5 minutes"
- "Now that the flavors start getting incorporated, add the remaining wine, the broth (if you use the bouillon method, add just a cup) and turn the heat down to low. The lid at this point has to cover only about ¾ of the pot. We want the steam to go out and the food to breath."
- "Cook for 2 hours at very low heat. Check the level of liquid and add broth/water as needed. Now, you should not need to add water because with a lid almost entirely con, the liquid should not consume quickly."
- "Serve hot with some solid red wine, such as a Barbera d&#39;Asti, a Barbaresco, or Rosso di Montalcino. If you don&#39;t like Italian wines, a Tempranillo Roja would fit this dish very nicely. If you want domestic wine, then I would pick some Pinot Noir from California or the NW over some American Cab."

<i>Before you jump to Mo&#39;s Short Ribs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is finished, most people do not wish to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Make smart choices when shopping for groceries. If you make smart decisions when you are shopping for your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to deal with a hectic store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You’re going to go home and make what you have on hand. Fill your cupboards with nutritious foods. This way—even if you decide on something a little greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still selecting foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are a good deal of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done every single day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. It is more about making your body as strong as it can be.
