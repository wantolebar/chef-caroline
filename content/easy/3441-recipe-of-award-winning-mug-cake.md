<i>Before you jump to Mug cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, nonetheless that is certainly not true. You get the greatest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
