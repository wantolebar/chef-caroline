<i>Before you jump to Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
