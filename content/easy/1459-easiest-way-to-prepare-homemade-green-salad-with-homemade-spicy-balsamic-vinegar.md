<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These kinds of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as efficiently as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. It's concerning being practical, usually.
