It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as economically as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can easily minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
