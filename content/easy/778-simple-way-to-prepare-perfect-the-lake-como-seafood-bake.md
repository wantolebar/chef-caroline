<i>Before you jump to The Lake Como Seafood Bake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. At the conclusion of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Climb stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. An costly gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. It’s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
