recipeingredient:
- "1.5 cups baby tomatoes"
- "1 medium onion cut into 1inch pieces any color is fine"
- "1/2 (1 pound) eggplant cut into 15inch cubes peeled if Italian peeling not necessary if Chinese or Japanese eggplants which have a much more delicate peel This is about 2 cups"
- "1 medium red yellow or orange bell pepper cored and cut into 1inch pieces"
- "4 Tablespoons olive oil"
- "1-2 cloves garlic minced 12 to 1 Tablespoon depending on how garlicky you like your food"
- "1/4 cup chopped parsley"
- "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to start"
- "1/8 teaspoon black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large pan (10 or 12-inch) with 2 Tablespoons of olive oil in it, add all the tomatoes, onion, eggplant, and bell pepper, and spread it out in an even layer over the entire cooking surface."
- "Put the pan on medium low heat, and let the veg roast, undisturbed, for about 12 minutes."
- "Add another 2 Tablespoons of oil and stir the veg to redistribute back into an even layer over the entire cooking surface, making sure all of your eggplant pieces are touching the cooking surface. Let the veg roast undisturbed again for another 12 minutes or so."
- "Add the garlic, parsley on top, and distribute the salt and pepper over the entire area of the ratatouille and gently and thoroughly fold into the veg mixture to ensure even seasoning throughout. Spreading the seasoning over the entire surface area of the ratatouille before folding it in helps to distribute it evenly and also prevents having to disturb the veg too much in order to get the seasoning incorporated."
- "Let the rataouille pan roast another 5 minutes or so, and that&#39;s it! Enjoy! :)"

<i>Before you jump to Pan Roasted Ratatouille for 2 recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Consider the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. It is more about making your body as powerful as it can be.
