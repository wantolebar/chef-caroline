recipeingredient:
- " Cubed Steak"
- " Flour Seasoned with Salt Pepper Cumin Paprika about one teaspoon of each"
- " Chopped Mushrooms"
- " Small Yellow Onion Diced"
- " Garlic minced"
- " Unsalted Beef Broth"
- " Oil For Frying Steaks"
- " Freshly chopped Thyme Leaves"
- " Butter"
- " Flour"
- " Chives or Parsley to Garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep all your ingredients. Salt and pepper your steaks on both sides and then dredge in the seasoned flour (I didn&#39;t measure my seasoning. Actually taste the flour and adjust to your taste preference.)"
- "Let your steaks sit in the flour while you heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Once pan is hot add your oil. You want enough oil to cover the pan by about half an inch. When oil just starts to ripple slowly add your steaks. Do them in batches like I did if you need to. Don&#39;t over crowd your pan. I fried up 2 at a time. Brown them on both sides and set on paper towels."
- "Drain excess oil from pan but leave the brown bits from frying. This will add extra flavor to the gravy. Turn heat to medium low and return pan to stove. Add your onions and butter to the pan and cook down until soft and golden. Scrape the brown bits from pan as the onions cook down."
- "Once the onions are soft and golden add the garlic and mushrooms. Stir and cook for just a minute. Add the tablespoon of flour and cook into the onions for just a few seconds. Slowly mix in your beef stock. You want to make sure the flour doesn&#39;t clump. It helps if your stock is at least room temp but it is even better if it&#39;s hot. Stir in the fresh thyme. Taste to see if you need to add any salt or pepper."
- "Bring to a simmer and then add the steak to the gravy. Making sure to coat them well."
- "Cover and reduce heat to low. Let simmer for about an hour. stir the gravy and flip the steaks about every 15 minutes. If the gravy seems to thick you can add a little more liquid or if it seems to thin let it cook uncovered for a while. The longer you let the steaks simmer in the gravy the more tender they&#39;ll become."
- "I served mine over rice and a side of cooked greens (kale in this case,) and garnished with chopped chives."

<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a place get started on as any. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. It goes further than merely replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Certainly this also happens in different rooms, not merely the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, after all. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
