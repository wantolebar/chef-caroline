Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as efficiently as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that hard. A lot of it truly is merely using common sense.
