<i>Before you jump to Pav Bhaji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty straightforward to live green, after all. A lot of it really is basically making use of common sense.
