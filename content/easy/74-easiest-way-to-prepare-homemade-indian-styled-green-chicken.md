<i>Before you jump to Indian styled Green Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, more often than not.
