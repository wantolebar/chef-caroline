- "1 x red onion"
- "2 x lemon grass sticks"
- "100 g x fresh ginger"

recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a large sauce pan or soup pot, add a splash of oil and the prawn trimmings. They will quickly turn pink, add the vegetables and herbs"
- "Stir in the tomato paste then add white wine and top up with water (about 1 Litre)"
- "Add the Thai paste, now split the lemon grass in half lengthways, if the very centre of lemon grass is soft then you can separate this to add to the finished soup, or you can just chop it all up for the stock"

- "When the stock has had around 1 hour simmering its time to stain it through the finest sieve that you have. I do mine once through a chinois then through a fine mess sieve, you can use muslin or cheese cloth for the best results. Now add the vegetables to the broth."
- "Add prawns and gently simmer until they turn pink 1 to 2 minutes should be long enough, season soup with salt pepper, sweet chilli and soy"
- "Add sliced chilli and some chopped coriander or parsley, time to serve. I chose the wrong bowl as it made it difficult to eat from but select a bowl you like spoon in the prawns and veg then pour over the amazingly flavoursome broth."
- "Tuck in now, feel free to add fish sauce more chilli or whatever you fancy, the last image here shows how the prawns curl up, I like the way the look and its easier to east half a prawn and keep your dignity LOL. Link to video if you like? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoHYWejWiVA&amp;t=363s"

<i>Before you jump to Thai style Prawn Broth recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Water is the very best beverage out there. Soda and coffee, when consumed in small amounts, aren't that bad. Getting all of your hydration from them is a horrendous idea. Having water instead of other types of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. This also helps you reduce your caloric intake by hundreds of points without needing to buy and eat terrible diet foods. Water is usually one of the keys to really slimming down and getting healthy.

There are a whole lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your health levels. You need to help make your body as strong it can be.
