<i>Before you jump to Leftover Vegetable Stir Fry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as economically as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
