<i>Before you jump to Lentil Lasagna recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably easy to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
