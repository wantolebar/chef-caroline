<i>Before you jump to Jake&#39;s fava fawai (A steamed fava beans knockout) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as effectively as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
