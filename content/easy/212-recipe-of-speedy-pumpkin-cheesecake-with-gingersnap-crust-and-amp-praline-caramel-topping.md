recipeinstructions:
- "Crush your gingersnaps ahead of time so you can make crust quicker.  Crush cookies and mix with other crust dry ingredients, seal tightly and set aside until ready to use."
- "TO MAKE CRUST:  Line the bottom of a 9 or 10 - inch springfoam pan with parchment paper and coat with cooking spray.  In a large bowl, stir together the melted butter with the crushed gingersnaps, sugar and cinnamon.  Press into the bottom of the prepared pan, working some of it up the sides, if desired."
- "Preheat the oven to 350째F."
- "TO MAKE FILLING:  Using a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese in a large bowl on medium-high speed about 1 minute, until fluffy.  Add sugar and beat until smooth, about 1 minute.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating on medium-high speed for 20 seconds after each addition.  Add vanilla, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger; beat on medium speed about 1 minute, until incorporated."
- "Pour the filling over crust.  Tear off a large sheet of foil and place the springfoam pan in the center, carefully folding up the sides.  This prevents the waterbath (waterbaths prevent cracks) from seeping into your cheesecake and making the crust soggy.  Put the wrapped pan into a larger baking pan and set it on the center rack of the oven.  Pour enough boiling water into the larger pan to reach halfway up the sides of the springfoam pan (this is a waterbath)."
- "Bake about 1 hour, until the filling is set and golden brown on top.  It should barely jiggle when the pan is gently slid.  Cool the cheesecake on a rack about 30 minutes, then remove from waterbath and chill for several hours or overnight.  Remove the cheesecake from the springfoam pan and set it on a large serving plate.  Make sure the plate is big enough to hold any of the praline sauce that drips over the top."
- "TO MAKE PRALINE TOPPING:  Prevent the oven to 350째F."
- "Arrange the pecans in a single layer and toast them for 7-9 minutes, until golden brown and aromatic.  Coarsely chop the nuts.  Stir together the brown sugar, cream and butter in a sauce pan over medium heat.  Boil the mixture for about 1 1/2 minutes, adjusting the heat to make sure it does not boil over.  DO NOT STIR.  Remove the pan from heat and stir in vanilla, salt and pecans."
- "Cool the topping at least 15 minutes before pouring over the top of the chilled cheesecake."
- "Serve immediately or cover and chill until ready to serve.  The cheesecake will keep, well wrapped in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days."

<i>Before you jump to Pumpkin Cheesecake with Gingersnap crust &amp; Praline Caramel topping recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that difficult. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.

##### Steps to make Pumpkin Cheesecake with Gingersnap crust &amp; Praline Caramel topping:

1. Crush your gingersnaps ahead of time so you can make crust quicker.  Crush cookies and mix with other crust dry ingredients, seal tightly and set aside until ready to use.
1. TO MAKE CRUST:  Line the bottom of a 9 or 10 - inch springfoam pan with parchment paper and coat with cooking spray.  In a large bowl, stir together the melted butter with the crushed gingersnaps, sugar and cinnamon.  Press into the bottom of the prepared pan, working some of it up the sides, if desired.
1. Preheat the oven to 350째F.
1. TO MAKE FILLING:  Using a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese in a large bowl on medium-high speed about 1 minute, until fluffy.  Add sugar and beat until smooth, about 1 minute.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating on medium-high speed for 20 seconds after each addition.  Add vanilla, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger; beat on medium speed about 1 minute, until incorporated.
1. Pour the filling over crust.  Tear off a large sheet of foil and place the springfoam pan in the center, carefully folding up the sides.  This prevents the waterbath (waterbaths prevent cracks) from seeping into your cheesecake and making the crust soggy.  Put the wrapped pan into a larger baking pan and set it on the center rack of the oven.  Pour enough boiling water into the larger pan to reach halfway up the sides of the springfoam pan (this is a waterbath).
1. Bake about 1 hour, until the filling is set and golden brown on top.  It should barely jiggle when the pan is gently slid.  Cool the cheesecake on a rack about 30 minutes, then remove from waterbath and chill for several hours or overnight.  Remove the cheesecake from the springfoam pan and set it on a large serving plate.  Make sure the plate is big enough to hold any of the praline sauce that drips over the top.
1. TO MAKE PRALINE TOPPING:  Prevent the oven to 350째F.
1. Arrange the pecans in a single layer and toast them for 7-9 minutes, until golden brown and aromatic.  Coarsely chop the nuts.  Stir together the brown sugar, cream and butter in a sauce pan over medium heat.  Boil the mixture for about 1 1/2 minutes, adjusting the heat to make sure it does not boil over.  DO NOT STIR.  Remove the pan from heat and stir in vanilla, salt and pecans.
1. Cool the topping at least 15 minutes before pouring over the top of the chilled cheesecake.
1. Serve immediately or cover and chill until ready to serve.  The cheesecake will keep, well wrapped in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.
