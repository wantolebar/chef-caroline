<i>Before you jump to Cream of Chicken, Cheese and Broccoli over Rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
