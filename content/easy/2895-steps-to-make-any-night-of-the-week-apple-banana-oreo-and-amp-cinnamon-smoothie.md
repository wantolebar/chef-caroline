Why don't we begin with something not that hard, changing the particular light bulbs. This will go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The family spends a lot of time in the cooking area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, of course. It's about being practical, more often than not.
