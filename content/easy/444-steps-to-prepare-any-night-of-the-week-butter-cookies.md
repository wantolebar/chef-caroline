<i>Before you jump to Butter cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as effectively as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
