<i>Before you jump to Mug Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is finished, most people do not want to go to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Walk up the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will decide to be idle and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. It is more about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
