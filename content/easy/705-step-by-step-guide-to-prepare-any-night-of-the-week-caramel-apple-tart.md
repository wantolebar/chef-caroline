recipeinstructions:
- "Preliminaries: Butter (not listed in ingredients) the tart pan lightly and chill the pan in the refrigerator."
- "Make the tart crust: Bring the butter to room temperature and whisk until it reaches a creamy consistency. Add the powdered sugar in 3 batches and mix well."
- "Add the egg gradually and mix well with each addition. Add the sifted flour and gently combine with a rubber spatula."
- "Bring the dough together and wrap in plastic wrap. Let it rest overnight in the refrigerator."
- "Put the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and roll it out 3mm thick. Line the chilled tart pan with the dough. Pierce the dough with a fork and chill in the refrigerator in the pan."
- "Weight down the crust with pie weights, and bake for about 20 minutes in a 180℃ oven. Once the rim of the crust starts to brown lightly, remove the weights and bake the bottom crust for 7 minutes."
- "Once the bottom starts to brown lightly, let it cool on a baking rack."
- "Make the almond Cream: Bring the butter to room temperature and whisk until it reaches a creamy consistency. Add the powdered sugar in 3 batches and mix well with each addition."
- "Add the egg gradually and mix well with each addition. Add the sifted almond flour and fold it in."
- "Let the cream rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour. In the meantime, we will caramelize the apples."
- "Make the apple filling: Peel the apples and cut into wedges. Soak in salt water and take them out immediately. Pat them completely dry with paper towels."
- "Heat the unsalted butter in a frying pan. Once melted, add the granulated sugar. Once it turns brown, turn off the heat and add the apples."
- "Saute the apples until they are lightly browned over low- medium heat. Sprinkle some rum in at the end. Do not let the apples burn, whatever you do."
- "The sauteed apples will stick together once they cooled down, so spread them out in a single layer to cool."
- "The rested almond cream will be cold and hardened, so soften it by mixing it well. Put the softened cream into the crust and smooth out the surface."
- "Arrange the sauteed apples on top of the almond dream, and bake the tart for 50 minutes in a 180℃ oven. While it&#39;s still hot, brush the top with apricot jam which has been passed through a sieve to remove any solid bits."
- "Once the tart has cooled down, remove it from the pan and brush on another layer of apricot jam. Optionally sprinkle some powdered sugar on the rim to make it look pretty."

<i>Before you jump to Caramel Apple Tart recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the selections you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Don't ignore that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You want your body to be powerful too.
