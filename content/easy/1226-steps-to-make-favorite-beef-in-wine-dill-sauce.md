<i>Before you jump to Beef in Wine Dill Sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is merely utilizing common sense.
