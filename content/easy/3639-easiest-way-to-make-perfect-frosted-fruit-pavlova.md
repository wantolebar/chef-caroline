recipeinstructions:
- "First draw a large circle on some baking parchment. I used a plate slightly smaller than the cake stand I was going to place the pavlova on at the end as a template."
- "Preheat the oven to 170c"
- "Whisk the egg whites until they are nice and stiff. When you take the whisk out there should be marks where the whisk has been that don’t flop down too much. This is often called “stiff peaks”"
- "And in the sugar tablespoon by tablespoon while still whisking and keep doing this until the sugar has all been used. It should look quite glossy."
- "Add in the rest of the meringue ingredients and whisk one more time."
- "With the large metal spoon, being careful not to mix too much, spoon the mixture within the circle you have drawn."
- "Spread out the mixture and try to have the outer circle higher up than the middle so it looks a bit like a tart."
- "Put the meringue into the oven for 1 hour. Then leave in the oven until the oven has cooled down."
- "Meanwhile make the frosted fruits. Gently whisk the egg white so it is a little frothy but not stiff like the meringue."
- "Put a handful of sugar on a small plate and have it next to the bowl with the whisked egg white."
- "Take the fruit and dip it first in the egg white and then roll it around on the sugar plate before transferring to a piece of baking parchment."
- "Repeat this until you have coated all the fruit you wish to use. You may need to top up your sugar plate and you may find the egg will make the sugar very wet."
- "Leave the fruit to dry and harden."
- "Once the meringue has cooled and the fruit has hardened, whip the double cream and then dollop and spread in the middle of the meringue. Arrange the fruit artistically and voila!"

This way—even if you choose something slightly greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still choosing foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are lots of things you can pursue to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start.
