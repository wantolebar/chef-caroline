<i>Before you jump to Oven Fried Green Tomatoes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as effectively as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
