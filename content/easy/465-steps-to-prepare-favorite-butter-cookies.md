Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is definitely not true. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is going. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's about being practical, usually.
