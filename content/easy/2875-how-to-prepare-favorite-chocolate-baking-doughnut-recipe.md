<i>Before you jump to Chocolate baking doughnut recipe recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
