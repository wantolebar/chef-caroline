Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, of course. It's about being sensible, usually.
