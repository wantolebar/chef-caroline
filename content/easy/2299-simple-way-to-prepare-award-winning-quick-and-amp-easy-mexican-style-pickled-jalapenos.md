ratingvalue: 3.2

recipeingredient:
- "1/3 pound jalapeo peppers about 5 or 6 large sliced into 18inch thick pieces"
- "1 medium carrot peeled and sliced in the diagonal into 18inch thick pieces"
- "1/2 a medium onion sliced into 14inch thick slices vertically"
- "1-2 garlic cloves peeled and cut into 2 or 3 slices"
- " optional habanero or scotch bonnet pepper cut into 3 or 4 even slices for added heat"
- "1  13 cups distilled white vinegar"
- "1 Tablespoon  1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1 Tablespoon  1 teaspoon sugar"
- "2 Tablespoons vegetable oil"
- "1/2 Tablespoon Mexican oregano"
- "1 bay leaf"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare a minimum 24 ounce jar or tight-lidded plastic container by washing with soap, rinsing with hot water, and drying thoroughly."
- "Pack your vegetables into the jar or container, placing the peppers, onions, carrots, and garlic in alternating layers."
- "Make the brine in a medium bowl by mixing the vinegar, salt, and sugar, and stirring or whisking until the salt and sugar are completely dissolved."
- "Pour the brine over the vegetables."
- "Bloom the oregano and bay leaf by heating the oil to medium hot and then stirring in the herbs - just a quick stir or two should do it. The oil should be hot enough for the herbs to gently sizzle when they go in, but you don&#39;t want the oil to smoke."
- "Pour the herbed oil into the pickle. If you&#39;re using a jar, screw the lid on tight and give it a few gentle shakes to distribute the oil throughout. If a snap-on lidded container, give the vegetables a few gentle presses with a spoon to distribute the oil. Either way, the oil will float back up to the top, but its flavor will be imparted to the brine."
- "Refrigerate the pickles. They&#39;ll be ready to eat in 45 minutes, and they&#39;ll keep at least a month refrigerated, if they last that long. ;)"

<i>Before you jump to Quick &amp; Easy Mexican Style Pickled Jalapeños recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Water is the very best beverage out there. Sipping a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. Using them for your only source of hydration, conversely, is dumb. Ingesting water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to aid your body in its health and hydration. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories from your diet— without having to be forced to eat terrible tasting diet food. Water is often one of the keys to successful weight-loss and healthfulness.

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need your body to be strong too.
