recipeingredient:
- "175 g caster sugar"
- "175 g butter"
- "140 g gluten free self raising flour I love doves farm"
- "50 g ground almonds"
- "3 eggs"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "1/4 tsp xanthan gum"
- "1 tsp vanilla essence"
- "1/2 teaspoon almond essence"
- " Pink and yellow food colouring gel"
- " To assemble"
- "500 g golden marzipan pre made or bought"
- "1 jar Apricot conserve"
- " Icing sugar for dusting counter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 160c. Melt the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds until soft. Once softened, add to a large mixing bowl with the sugar. Whisk to a cream with an electric whisk for 2-3 mins."
- "Add the almonds, eggs, baking powder, xanthan gum, vanilla essence and almond essence. Whisk with the electric whisk for 30 seconds to combine."
- "Sift in the flour. Fold in with a metal spoon until a smooth mixture has formed."
- "Split the mixture equally into two bowls. Add 3 small drops of colouring gel to each bowl and stir. Add more if you want darker colours. Gel works better than liquid colouring as it doesnâ€™t affect the consistency of the cake mix."
- "Distribute the mixture into two rectangular tins."
- "If you donâ€™t have a battenburg tin loaf tins work well, or use a square tin divided into two."
- "Cook at 160c for 15-25 mins. Using long rectangular tins took 18 mins, but it will depend on the size of tin you use. Cook until the cakes start to brown on the top. Use a cake tester or end of a teaspoon to check itâ€™s cooked through in the middle."
- "Once fully cooled, use a sharp knife to slice the cake in half long ways."
- "Microwave the apricot jam for 30 seconds until runny. Dust a large chopping board or worktop with icing sugar and use a rolling pin to roll out the marzipan so it it big enough to cover all 4 sides of the cake. Use a teaspoon to coat in a layer of jam."
- "Carefully lift the cake slices into the centre of marzipan. Use the remaining jam as a glue to hold the segments together."
- "Fold the marzipan over the cake. Flip the cake over so the join is at the bottom. Use a sharp knife to cut either end to make them neat. Serve and enjoy!"
