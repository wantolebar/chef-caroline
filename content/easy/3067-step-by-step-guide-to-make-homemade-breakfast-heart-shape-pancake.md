Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Let us begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. Accomplish this for the whole house, not merely the kitchen. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent style, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more initially, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This also occurs in the rest of the house, but we are trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. It's concerning being practical, most of the time.
