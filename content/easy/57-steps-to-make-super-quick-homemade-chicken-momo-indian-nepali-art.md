<i>Before you jump to Chicken momo (Indian/Nepali art) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as effectively as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
