<i>Before you jump to Murgh Kari (Indian Chicken Curry) #chickencontest recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Start out with changing the lights. This will certainly go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more originally, these bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. Using these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This also occurs in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. It's about being practical, usually.
