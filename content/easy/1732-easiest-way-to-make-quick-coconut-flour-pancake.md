<i>Before you jump to Coconut Flour Pancake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. It's concerning being functional, more often than not.
