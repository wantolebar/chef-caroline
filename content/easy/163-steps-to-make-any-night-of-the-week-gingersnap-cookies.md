- " unsalted butter softened"

- " white sugar or as needed for rolling cookies"
recipeinstructions:
- "Whisk flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, cloves, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large mixing bowl"
- "Cream the butter and 2/3 cup sugar together in a separate bowl until smooth, for about 2 minutes. Add the candied ginger, molasses, vanilla, and egg. Whisk until well blended."
- "Add dry ingredients to butter/sugar mixture and mix just until the flour disappears. Cover dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour"
- "Preheat oven to 350F (175C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour 1/2 cup sugar in a small shallow dish for rolling cookies."
- "Form dough into 1 1/2 teaspoon balls, then roll in the sugar before placing on the lined baking sheet."
- "Flatten the cookies to about 1/4 inch thick. (I like to cover the cookie with a small piece of parchment or plastic wrap and then flatten with the bottom of a 1/4 cup measuring cup. The plastic or paper helps keep the cookie from sticking to whatever you use to flatten it). I have also tried rolling out the dough 1/4 inch thick to cut out gingersnap people with a cookie cutter. Dough will soften up if you do this, so rechill as needed."
- "Sprinkle cookies with a pinch of sugar before baking in preheated oven for 10-15 minutes. (Less time for a chewier cookie, more time for a snappier cookie)"
- "Once cookies are cooled, you can decorate with icing if desired, but they really don&#39;t need anything and are delicious on their own!"

<i>Before you jump to Gingersnap Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a spot to begin with as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them rather than incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. You also have to acquire the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. This additionally takes place in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
