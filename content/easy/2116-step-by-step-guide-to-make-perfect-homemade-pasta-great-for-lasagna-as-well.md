<i>Before you jump to Homemade Pasta (Great for Lasagna as well) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
