- "1 tsp baking powder"
- "1 tsp bicarb of sodabaking soda"
- "30 ml olive oil"
- "1/2 medium avocado well mashed"
- "240 ml water"
- "120 grams sugar"
- "1 tbsp apple cider vinegar"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"

- "250 grams icingpowdered sugar"
- "2 tbsp cocoa powder or to taste"
- " Ganache"
- "150 ml double  heavy  coconut cream"
- "150 grams good quality dark chocolate"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven to gas 4 / 180C / 350°F and line a shallow tin such as for brownies or swiss roll with greaseproof paper"
- "Mix the flour, cocoa and salt together"
- "In a separate bowl combine the sugar, water, oil and avocado. Mix well and add to the dry ingredients and combine well"
- "In a small bowl combine the baking powder, soda, vinegar then vanilla. Mix until well frothed up then add to the cake batter. Don&#39;t overmix or you&#39;ll knock all the air out"
- "Quickly pour into the shallow cake tin and put in the oven for 12-15 minutes or until JUST ALMOST done or you won&#39;t be able to roll it"
- "Lay another piece of greaseproof paper on top of the sponge. Use the bottom paper to roll the sponge over jelly/swiss roll style so the top piece of paper is rolled inside. Don&#39;t roll too tight or the cake will crack when you undo it. Let cool 15 minutes then unroll carefully - you are not rolling it completely flat, that will break it. Just loosening it"
- "Make up buttercream icing by creaming the butter, sugar and cocoa (you might like more cocoa in it) together, remove the paper and spread on top of the sponge, then roll back up again. Cover the whole sponge including ends in the rest of the buttercream"

- "To make the ganache for the top, first chop up the chocolate quite small. Bring the cream to the boil in a saucepan and as soon as it does, take the pan off the heat and whisk in the chocolate. At this stage you could add a tsp of rum, orange essence or any other flavouring but it&#39;s not necessary"
- "Let the ganache cool to the point where it&#39;s not hot enough to melt the buttercream icing but is still spreadable and put into a piping bag"
- "Take the log out of the fridge and pipe the ganache all over remembering the ends. It should settle into the grooves you already made nicely but you can gently go over them again if you want to. Put back into the fridge to harden"
- "When ready to serve give a dusting of powdered sugar. Traditionally these are decorated to resemble forests with lots of greenery on top"

<i>Before you jump to Vickys Christmas Yule Log, GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Go up the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You really want your body to be powerful too.
