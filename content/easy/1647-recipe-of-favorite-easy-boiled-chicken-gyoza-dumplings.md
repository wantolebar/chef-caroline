recipeingredient:
- "100 to 200 grams Ground chicken dark meat"
- "1 stalk Japanese leek"
- "1 Egg"
- "2 tbsp Weipa"
- "2 tbsp Hot water"
- "1 Sesame seeds"
- "1 packet Gyoza skins"
recipeinstructions:
- "Dissolve the Weipa paste in the hot water. If you don&#39;t have any Weipa, use Chinese soup stock granules and a little soy sauce."
- "Finely chop the leek: Make cuts along the length diagonally, on both sides. Slice, and you&#39;ll end up with very fine dice."
- "The ground chicken I used is from the thigh; it&#39;s juicier than breast meat. If you only have ground white chicken, add a little sesame oil to make it juicier."
- "Mix the ground chicken and the dissolved soup stock from step 1 until the mixture is sticky. Add the egg, leek and sesame seeds and mix well. It&#39;s OK if the mixture is very loose."
- "Wrap the mixture in gyoza skins in any shape you like. Form any leftover mixture into meatballs."
- "Bring a pan of water to a boil, and put in the meatballs first with a spoon."
- "Put in the gyoza dumplings. When they come floating to the surface and the skins are transparent they are done."
- "Eat with ponzu sauce. They&#39;re bouncy and juicy on the inside."
- "You can cool the meatballs and freeze them for use later in hot pots and so on."
- "This is a hamburger I made for my daughter with the meat mixture, panfried in a frying pan with cheese on top. You don&#39;t need any ketchup."

<i>Before you jump to Easy Boiled Chicken Gyoza Dumplings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Make smart choices when grocery shopping. When you make wise choices at the grocery store, your meals will get much healthier automatically. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with jampacked grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to get home immediately and have something great. Your kitchen should be filled with healthy foods and ingredients. This makes it easy to have a great meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is naturally better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are many things you can do to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Trying to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need your body to be powerful too.
