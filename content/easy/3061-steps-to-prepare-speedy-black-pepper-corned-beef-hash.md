It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These kinds of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Probably the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. As soon as you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply utilizing common sense.
