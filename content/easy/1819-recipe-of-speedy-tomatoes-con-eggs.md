<i>Before you jump to Tomatoes con Eggs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are a whole lot of things that factor into getting healthy. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need your body to be strong too.
