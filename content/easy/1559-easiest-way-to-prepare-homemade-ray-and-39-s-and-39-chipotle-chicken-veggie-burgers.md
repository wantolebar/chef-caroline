It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around.

You also have to acquire the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The family spends a lot of time in the cooking area, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long.
