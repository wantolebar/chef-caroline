<i>Before you jump to Butter cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as effectively as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
