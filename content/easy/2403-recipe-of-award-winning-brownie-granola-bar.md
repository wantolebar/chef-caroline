<i>Before you jump to Brownie granola bar recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's about being practical, most of the time.
