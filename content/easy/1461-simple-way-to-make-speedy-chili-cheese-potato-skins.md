recipeingredient:
- "6 small russet potatoes about 3 in long select unblemished potatoes as we are using the skins"
- "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil"
- "1/2 tsp paprika"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/4 tsp pepper"
- "1/4 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 cup to 2 cup Chili I use leftovers from when I make homemade but you can use canned chili"
- "2 cup shredded cheese I like cheddar or pepper jack"
- "8 oz sour cream will not use all"
- "1 Optional  crumbled bacon or Oscar Mayer Selects real bacon bits for a shortcut"
- "2 tbsp sliced green onions or chopped chives  for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Scrub potatoes clean, poke a few holes in each with a fork or knife tip. Place in microwave and cook until fork tender, usually 12 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine olive oil, paprika, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Set aside."
- "When potatoes are done let cool until they are easy to handle. Gently slice potatoes in half lengthwise being careful not to tear the skins."
- "Using a spoon carefully scoop flesh out of the center leaving behind about 1/4 in. intact on the skins. Again be careful not to tear the skins. (And let&#39;s not be wasteful. Save the scooped out flesh for another use like potato cakes, mashed potatoes or gnocchi.)"
- "Preheat oven to 450°F, brush each potato half with oil mixture, inside and out. Place skin side up on baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Flip flesh side up so our little &#34;wells&#34; are ready to fill and bake another 10 minutes."
- "Meanwhile reheat chili slightly in microwave. Warming the chili helps it spread out to fill the skins. Remove potato skins from oven. Fill each with about a tablespoon or so of chili (depends on how full you want them) and top with a small mound of cheese."
- "Return to oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. You can broil here, but only about 2 min for that and keep an eye on them so they don&#39;t burn."
- "Remove from oven, top each with a dollop of sour cream, green onions/chives and bacon if desired. Eat and enjoy!"

<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Perhaps the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
