recipeingredient:
- "4 egg whites Large"
- "1 Cup Castor sugar"
- "1/2 Teaspoon Vanilla extract"
- "1 Teaspoon White vinegar"
- "1/2 Tablespoon Corn flour"
- "1 Cup Heavy cream"
- "1   1/2 Tablespoons sugar Granulated"
- "1/2 Teaspoon Vanilla extract"
- " Fruits   of   your   choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 130 degrees C and place rack in center of oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper."
- "In the bowl of your electric mixer, with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on medium speed until they hold soft peaks."
- "Start adding the sugar, a tablespoon at a time, and continue to beat, on high speed, until the meringue holds very stiff and shiny peaks."
- "Test to see if the sugar is fully dissolved by rubbing a little of the meringue between your thumb and index finger. The meringue should feel smooth, not gritty. If it feels gritty the sugar has not fully dissolved so keep beating until it feels smooth between your fingers"
- "Beat in the vanilla extract. Sprinkle the vinegar and cornstarch over the top of the meringue and, with a rubber spatula, gently fold in."
- "Spread the meringue inside the circle drawn on the parchment paper, smoothing the edges, making sure the edges of the meringue are slightly higher than the center."
- "Bake for 60 to 75 minutes or until the outside is dry and is a very pale cream color. Turn the oven off, leave the door slightly ajar, and let the meringue cool completely in the oven."
- "The outside of the meringue will feel firm to the touch, if gently pressed, but as it cools you will get a little cracking and you will see that the inside is soft and marshmallowy."
- "Whip the cream in your electric mixer, with the whisk attachment, until soft peaks form. Sweeten with the sugar and vanilla and then mound the softly whipped cream into the center of the meringue."
- "Arrange the fruit randomly, or in a decorative pattern, on top of the cream. Serve immediately as this dessert does not hold for more than a few hours."

<i>Before you jump to Pavlova recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is finished, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Consider the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are lots of things you can pursue to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done each day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. It has more to do with making your body as strong as it can be.
