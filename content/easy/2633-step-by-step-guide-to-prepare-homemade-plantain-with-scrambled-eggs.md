<i>Before you jump to Plantain with scrambled eggs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Begin with exchanging the light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than simply exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular will often be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
