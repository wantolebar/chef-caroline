<i>Before you jump to Asian Marinated Chicken w/ Bacon Steamed Fresh Green Beans recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, of course. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
