<i>Before you jump to Bone broth recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Start with changing the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. You really need to change your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a small amount more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Utilizing these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than merely swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house at the same time. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that difficult. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
