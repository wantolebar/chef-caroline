- " Corn on the cob with the husk on"
recipeinstructions:
- "Use a corn on the cob with its husk on."
- "Peel the husks, leaving the last 5 or 6 layers."
- "Peek inside. If you leave about this many it&#39;s OK. Wrap the husks back over the corn before putting it in the microwave."
- "Microwave the corn just like that for 3 minutes at 600w. Turn it over (don&#39;t burn yourself! ) and microwave for another 3 minutes. Done."
- "It&#39;s very hot , but carefully peel the husk off...the silk will come off cleanly too."
- "It&#39;s peeled cleanly.  It&#39;s so pretty. You can cut off the husk with kitchen scissors."
- "If cooking 2 corn cobs at the same time, it works well if you microwave on one side for 4 minutes, turn over and microwave for another 3 minutes and 30 seconds."
- "The microwave cooking time varies depending on how big the corn cobs are and your microwave, so please adjust."
- "If you leave cooked corn on the cob as is, it becomes all wrinkly...so if you&#39;re storing it for later, wrap it up in plastic wrap as soon as possible."
- "Be careful when you open the microwave oven door since it&#39;s very steamy in there. Be careful not to burn yourself! Be careful when turning the corn or taking them out."
- "If you do wash it (see step 11)...some really hot water may drip out from the corn so be careful."

<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. These kinds of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. As soon as you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is going. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
