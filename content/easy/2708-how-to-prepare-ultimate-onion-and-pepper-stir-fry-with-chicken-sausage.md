Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.
