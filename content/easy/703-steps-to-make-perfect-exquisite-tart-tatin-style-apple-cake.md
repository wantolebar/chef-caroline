recipeingredient:
- "1 medium to large  Apples"
- "10 grams Butter to coat the mold"
- " Caramel sauce"
- "50 grams  Sugar"
- "1 generous  tablespoon  Water"
- " Cake batter"
- "70 grams Almond powder"
- "60 grams Sugar"
- "1 Egg separate the yolk and white"
- "1 tbsp Apricot jam"
- "1/2 tsp Lemon juice"
- "20 grams Cake flour"
- "1/4 tsp Baking powder"
- "40 grams Melted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, make the caramel sauce. Put the caramel sauce ingredients in a pot, heat on medium, melt the sugar and slowly simmer until golden brown. Turn off the heat, then place pot on a damp towel, allow to cool to harden the caramel."
- "While waiting for the caramel to harden, prepare the apples and preheat the oven. Peel the apples, cut in half, core, then thinly slice into 2 to 3 mm wedges. Preheat the oven to 250°C."
- "After the caramel hardens, coat the caramel surface and the sides of the pot in butter. Since the butter and caramel will melt when baking, don&#39;t be concerned if they are lumpy. I recommend using your fingers to spread the butter after measuring it out."
- "Line the surface of the caramel with the sliced apples. After placing 2 or 3 end slices, lay the rest of the slices around in a circle while overlapping them. (Arranging the slices nicely will give the cake a pretty finish, but for those who don&#39;t mind, just lay the pieces flat.)"
- "Put the pot in the oven preheated to 250°C and bake for 12 minutes. If you have space on top of the oven (outside the oven), put the butter for the batter in a heat-resistant dish and simply let the butter melt in residual heat from the oven."
- "While baking the apples, let&#39;s make the batter! Put the almond powder, sugar, and egg white in a bowl, thoroughly mix together with a rubber spatula, then add the egg  yolk, apricot jam, and lemon juice, then thoroughly mix to incorporate air."
- "The apples should be done. Remove the pot from the oven, gently tip the pot, then pour out the juice from the baked apples into a separate dish to adjust the water content. Keep the leftover juices as it&#39;ll be used later."
- "After adjusting the water content, re-position the apple slices in the pot. If there are any gaps or if the apples are not lying flat, use a spoon to  press flat."
- "Set the oven to 200°C. For the batter, sprinkle the butter into the batter from Step 6, mix until smooth, then pour in the leftover apple juices and stir."
- "Combine the cake flour and baking powder and sift into the bowl, then, with a rubber spatula, fold in with cutting motions without kneading. Thoroughly mix until the batter becomes shiny. (With the rubber spatula, repeatedly trace a &#34;J&#34; on the bottom of the pan while turning the bowl towards you.)"
- "Pour the batter into the pot, then level it out. Bake for 8 minutes in an oven preheated to 200°C, reset oven to 180°C, then bake for 12 minutes, then reset oven to 170°C and bake for 3 more minutes."
- "It should look like this fresh from the oven. Pierce it with a skewer, and if it comes out clean, it&#39;s finished! Place a sheet of aluminum foil over the pot, and let&#39;s wait for the cake to cool. (If overbaked, the cake will be crumbly and dry)."
- "When the cake cools, with the aluminum foil in place, firmly hold the pot, and lightly agitate (give it a good, hard shake to dislodge the contents.) The caramelized apples should separate from the pot, and the cake should come out easily."
- "If the cake doesn&#39;t want to come out, or if the caramel has hardened and the cake won&#39;t budge, heat the pot over the stove and it should come right out. If you force it, the apples will end up a tragic mess, so be careful when removing the cake!"
- "Remove the aluminum foil, hold the pot over a dish one size larger than the pot, then carefully flip the pot over."
- "It should look like this."
- "Slice into desired size pieces and serve."

<i>Before you jump to Exquisite Tart Tatin-style Apple Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Consider the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need to help make your body as strong as possible.

##### Instructions to make Exquisite Tart Tatin-style Apple Cake:

1. First, make the caramel sauce. Put the caramel sauce ingredients in a pot, heat on medium, melt the sugar and slowly simmer until golden brown. Turn off the heat, then place pot on a damp towel, allow to cool to harden the caramel.
1. While waiting for the caramel to harden, prepare the apples and preheat the oven. Peel the apples, cut in half, core, then thinly slice into 2 to 3 mm wedges. Preheat the oven to 250°C.
1. After the caramel hardens, coat the caramel surface and the sides of the pot in butter. Since the butter and caramel will melt when baking, don&#39;t be concerned if they are lumpy. I recommend using your fingers to spread the butter after measuring it out.
1. Line the surface of the caramel with the sliced apples. After placing 2 or 3 end slices, lay the rest of the slices around in a circle while overlapping them. (Arranging the slices nicely will give the cake a pretty finish, but for those who don&#39;t mind, just lay the pieces flat.)
1. Put the pot in the oven preheated to 250°C and bake for 12 minutes. If you have space on top of the oven (outside the oven), put the butter for the batter in a heat-resistant dish and simply let the butter melt in residual heat from the oven.
1. While baking the apples, let&#39;s make the batter! Put the almond powder, sugar, and egg white in a bowl, thoroughly mix together with a rubber spatula, then add the egg  yolk, apricot jam, and lemon juice, then thoroughly mix to incorporate air.
1. The apples should be done. Remove the pot from the oven, gently tip the pot, then pour out the juice from the baked apples into a separate dish to adjust the water content. Keep the leftover juices as it&#39;ll be used later.
