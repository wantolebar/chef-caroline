<i>Before you jump to Easy Homemade Guacamole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that hard. Largely, all it requires is a little common sense.
