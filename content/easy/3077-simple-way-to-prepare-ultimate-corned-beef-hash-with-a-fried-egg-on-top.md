Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. As soon as you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it truly is simply utilizing common sense.
