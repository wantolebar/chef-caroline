<i>Before you jump to Indian Chicken Curry 
#mycookbook recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn‚Äôt have to be a chore. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some hints to be as healthful as possible.

Run the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. Obviously this isn‚Äôt as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. An costly gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do plenty to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. You need to help to make your body as strong you can make it.
