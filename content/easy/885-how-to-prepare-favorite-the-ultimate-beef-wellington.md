recipeinstructions:
- "FOR THE DUXELLES:"
- "Add mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped."
- "Add butter and olive oil to a large saute pan and set over medium heat."
- "Add the shallot and mushroom mixture and saute for 8 to 10 minutes until most the liquid has evaporated."
- "Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool."
- "FOR THE BEEF:"
- "Tie the tenderloin in 4 places so it holds its cylindrical shape while cooking."
- "Drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper and sear all over, including the ends, in a hot, heavy-based skillet lightly coated with olive oil - about 2 to 3 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a foot and a half in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up in it) on top of your cutting board."
- "Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to encompass the entire filet of beef."
- "Using a rubber spatula, cover evenly with a thin layer of duxelles."
- "Season the surface of the duxelles with salt and pepper and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves."
- "When the beef is seared, remove from heat, cut off twine, and smear lightly all over with Dijon mustard."
- "Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in the duxelles covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to tie it nice and tight."
- "Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef."
- "Roll it up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to seal it completely and hold it in a nice log shape."
- "Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it maintains its shape."
- "Preheat the oven to 425°F."
- "On a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to about 1/4&#34; thickness."
- "Depending on the size of your sheets, you may have to overlap 2 sheets and press them together."
- "Remove beef from the refrigerator and cut off plastic."
- "Set the beef in the center of the pastry and fold over the longer sides, brushing with egg wash to seal. Trim ends if necessary then brush with egg wash and fold over to completely seal the beef."
- "Top with coarse salt."
- "Place the beef seam side down on a baking sheet."
- "Brush the top of the pastry with egg wash then make a couple of slits in the top of the pastry using the tip of a paring knife; this creates vents that will allow the steam to escape when cooking."
- "Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until pastry is golden brown and beef registers 125°F on an instant-read thermometer."
- "Remove from oven and rest 10 minutes before cutting into thick slices."
- "Garnish with minced chives and serve with green peppercorn sauce, roasted fingerling potatoes, and warm wilted winter greens."
- "FOR THE GREEN PEPPERCORN SAUCE:"
- "Add olive oil to pan after removing beef."
- "Add shallots, garlic, and thyme; saute for 1 to 2 minutes."
- "Off heat, add brandy and flambe using a long kitchen match."
- "After flame dies down, return to the heat, add stock, and reduce by about half."
- "Strain out solids, then add 2 cups of cream and mustard."
- "Reduce by half again, then shut off heat and add green peppercorns."
- "FOR THE ROASTED FINGERLING POTATOES with FRESH HERBS &amp; GARLIC:"
- "Preheat oven to 500°F and place a baking sheet inside to heat."
- "Add potatoes, rosemary, sage, thyme, and garlic to a medium bowl."
- "Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper."
- "Remove sheet from oven, lightly coat with olive oil, and pour potatoes onto pan."
- "Place potatoes in oven and reduce heat to 425°F."
- "Roast for 20 minutes, or until crispy on the outside and tender on the inside."
- "FOR THE WARM WILTED WINTER GREENS:"
- "Cook honey and balsamic together over medium-high heat in a large sauce pan, about 5 minutes."
- "Toast walnuts in a small skillet; set aside to cool."
- "Pule greens on platter."

<i>Before you jump to The Ultimate Beef Wellington recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is complete, most people do not wish to go to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some hints to be as healthful as possible.

Drink water, not other drinks. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every once in a while isn’t a terrible idea. Getting all your hydration from them is a horrendous idea. When you choose water more than other beverages you are helping your body remain very healthy and hydrated. This also helps you reduce your caloric intake by hundreds of points without having to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Water is often the main element to successful weight reduction and healthfulness.

There are many things you can go after to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need to make your body as strong it can be.
