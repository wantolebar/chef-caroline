<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
