recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a medium pan over a high heat and add Frylight so it covers entire base of the saucepan. (Or if using regular oil add that and swill it around to coat the base in a thin layer)."
- "Add the garlic and fry for 20 seconds then add the sliced mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Place the sliced bread in the toaster at your desired setting. Stir the mushrooms and garlic until they shrink down by half and then add the cream cheese. Turn the heat down low now so it doesn&#39;t split."

- "Using a timer, add the egg gently and remove after two minutes with a slotted spoon. Touch the top of the egg to feel if it&#39;s slightly firm to the touch and the white is cooked through.

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is done, most people do not wish to go to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some hints to be as healthful as possible.

Be sensible when you do your grocery shopping. Making good decisions when buying food means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. At the end of your day do you really want to deal with jampacked grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to get home quickly and have something great. Your kitchen should be stocked with healthy foods and ingredients. This makes it simple to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is naturally better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are a whole lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start.
