<i>Before you jump to Meatball Sub Sandwich recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
