<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s, &#34;Easy As Pie!&#34; Berry Mix recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not wish to go to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Go up the stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are many things you can go after to become healthy. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. It’s about making your body as strong as it can be.
