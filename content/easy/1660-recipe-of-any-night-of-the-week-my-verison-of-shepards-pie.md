<i>Before you jump to My verison of shepards pie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Consider the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Trying to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your lifestyle choices. It’s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
