recipeingredient:
- "3 large potatoes use a fluffy potato like Maris Piper"
- "200 grams (9 ounces) tinned corned beef"
- "2 tbsp oil for pan frying"
- "1 large onion sliced"
- "600 ml hot water"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce"
- "1-2 beef OXO stock cubes"
- " sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to season"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the potatoes and start frying your onions on a medium-low heat in a stockpot. After 3-4 minutes, slice off the fat from the corned beef and stir in to the pan with the onions until it melts. Cook until the onions begin to brown, without being too soft. Tip: corned beef is much easier to slice when it&#39;s been kept in the fridge"
- "Cube the potatoes to about ½ to ¾ of an inch, chop the remaining corned beef and add to the pan. Add the hot water. There&#39;s plenty of flavour in the skins, so try tying in a muslin pouch, or a ladies hairnet and adding to the pan"
- "Bring to the boil then add the Worcestershire sauce and crumble in the stock cubes. Stir well and cook, uncovered, on a rolling boil for 10 minutes stirring occasionally"
- "Season and stir well (remove the potato skins if using). Taste and if you want a little extra savoury flavour, add another OXO Cube and a splash of Worcestershire. Reduce, uncovered, on a medium-low heat, for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally"
- "When the hash is thick with a little gravy. Remove from the heat and leave to cool, uncovered, and thicken a little more. Reheat when ready to serve in"
- "Serve with brown sauce, pickled red cabbage, pickled beetroot, cream crackers, or crusty bread"
- "Leftovers can be frozen easily in a food container and heated at a later date. This also makes a great pie filling. Simply put in a pie dish, cover with a shortcrust pastry, brush with egg wash, and cook until the pastry is golden brown..."

<i>Before you jump to Tex&#39;s Corned Beef &#39;Tator Hash 🐮 recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Make smart decisions when shopping for groceries. If you make smart choices when you are purchasing your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with packed grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You’re going to go home and use what you have in the cupboards. Fill your pantry shelves with healthy foods. This makes it simple to have a great meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is naturally better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Don't ignore that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It’s about making your body as strong as it can be.
