It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it.

Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a spot to begin with as any. This will certainly go outside of the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do.

This additionally happens in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. It's about being functional, more often than not.
