<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s DIM SUM Brunch recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
