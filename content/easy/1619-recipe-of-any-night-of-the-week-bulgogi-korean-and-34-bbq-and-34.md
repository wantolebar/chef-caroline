recipeingredient:
- " beef ribeye or skirt steak work well very thinly sliced I dont recommend super lean cuts for this preparation"
- " whole green onion white and green parts chopped"
- " finely minced garlic about 3 cloves"
- " of a sweet apple finely grated you can use 3 Tablespoons apple sauce in a pinch to tenderize and sweeten"
- " sugar"
- " toasted sesame oil"
- " regular soy sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all ingredients thoroughly in a mixing bowl and ideally allow to marinate for at least 30 minutes before cooking. For me, the best way to get all the meat evenly seasoned is to get in there with your hands and mix and massage to distribute all the seasonings thoroughly and evenly."
- "PAN FRY OR SAUTE METHOD: Cook the meat in four separate batches on an oil (about 1.5 teaspoons per batch) pan preheated to medium high, for 2.5 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure all pieces are cooked. If you, like I, love onions, you can saute some 1/4-inch thick pieces of sliced onions with each batch."
- "OVEN METHOD: Preheat the oven to 425F. Mix an additional 1.5 to 2 Tablespoons oil in with the meat and spread the meat evenly in a single layer on a foil-lined sheet pan or broiler pan. Place the pan about 4 inches under the heat element and cook for 15 minutes."
- "GRILL METHOD: You&#39;ll need a grill basket or screen to keep the meat from falling through the slats. Spread the meat in a single layer and cook over medium high heat (and at least 5 inches above the goals or gas element) until the meat is cooked. 3 to 5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the cut and grill heat."
- "Enjoy! :)"

<i>Before you jump to Bulgogi 불고기 (Korean &#34;BBQ&#34;) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthful.

Go up the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an attempt on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are a good deal of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. Little things, when done every single day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the decisions you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need to help to make your body as strong it can be.
