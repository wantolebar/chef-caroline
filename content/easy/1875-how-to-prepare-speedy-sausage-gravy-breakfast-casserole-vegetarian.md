recipeingredient:
- "3 cans sliced potatoes"
- "2 TBS butter"
- "1/4 C flour"
- "4 C milk"
- "10 veggie sausage patties"
- "1 can of 8 biscuits"
- "8 eggs"
- "1/8 C milk"
- "2 C shredded cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350"
- "Fry potatoes with a little oil on med heat until outsides are brown (usually 10-15 min) ** to avoid mushy potatoes, DRY them first! With paper towels, or bake in the oven for 5-10 minutes (or both!)"
- "Whisk eggs and 1/8C milk in a bowl. (You can use up to 12 eggs if your dish is big enough)"
- "Over low heat, melt 2 TBS butter in med saucepan, when melted, whisk with flour until little dough-balls form. Add about 4C milk and increase to high heat. Stir frequently, and AS SOON as it boils, drop heat back down to low."
- "Meanwhile, microwave veggie sausage patties, just enough to be thawed (If you&#39;re using meat sausage - you need to actually cook it first) (or just try the veggie ones. I use morningstar farms for this - no one knows the difference)"
- "Chop up (or pulse in blender) sausage and add to gravy. Let cook until gravy starts to thicken. Usually 8-10 minutes. Stir often! It will burn on the bottom! I add a good bit of salt and pepper too."
- "Grease casserole dish. Put potatoes on the bottom. Layer biscuits on top of potatoes."
- "Pour eggs (and make sure they thoroughly soak through to the bottom of the pan) Run a spatula around the edges to make sure eggs even out. Layer with cheese"
- "Lastly, pour on sausage gravy!"
- "I cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes on, 20 minutes off. (It can take less or longer depending on your pan. I use a deep casserole, glass, 9×13.) Just check the middle to make sure eggs aren&#39;t runny."
- "Cut into 8 servings-12 servings. Let it cool - the middle will be -ruin your tongue - hot!"
- "Note about exploding Pirex! There was a wave of more cheaply made Pirex (or the like) - usually with thinner handles or lighter feel - that is notorious for exploding in your oven. (Google exploding Pirex) Varied ingredient temperatures in layers is definitely a trigger for this! Because this has some pre-cooked/hot layers, I stick my well greased dish in the oven while pre-heating to warm it up first. &amp; I let my potatoes &amp; gravy sit for a minute - stirring to release steam-before adding!"

<i>Before you jump to Sausage Gravy Breakfast Casserole (vegetarian) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Let's begin with something not that hard, changing the actual light bulbs. Accomplish this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more initially, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Utilizing these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to acquire the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The family spends major time in the kitchen, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Obviously this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
