According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes.

You need to replace your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more originally, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. You also have to obtain the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. It's about being practical, usually.
