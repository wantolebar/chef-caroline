<i>Before you jump to Strawberry Cheesecake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty straightforward to live green, of course. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
