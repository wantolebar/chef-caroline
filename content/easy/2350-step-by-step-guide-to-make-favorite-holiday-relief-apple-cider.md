Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can easily minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, after all. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
