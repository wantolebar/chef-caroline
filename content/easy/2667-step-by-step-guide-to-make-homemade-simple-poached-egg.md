It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Probably the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that hard. It's related to being practical, usually.
