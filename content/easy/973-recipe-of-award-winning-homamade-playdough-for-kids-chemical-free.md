<i>Before you jump to Homamade PlayDough For Kids (Chemical free) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that tough. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
