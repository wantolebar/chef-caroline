Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, of course. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
