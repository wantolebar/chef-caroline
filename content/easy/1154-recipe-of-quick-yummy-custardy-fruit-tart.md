<i>Before you jump to Yummy custardy  fruit tart recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that hard. It's concerning being practical, more often than not.
