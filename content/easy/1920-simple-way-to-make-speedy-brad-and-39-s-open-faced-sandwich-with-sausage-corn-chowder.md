<i>Before you jump to Brad&#39;s open faced sandwich with sausage corn chowder recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
