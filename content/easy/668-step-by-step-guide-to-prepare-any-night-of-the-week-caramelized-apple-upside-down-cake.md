recipeingredient:
- " Caramelized Apples"
- " Apples"
- " Lemon juice omit if you are using Jonathan or Kogyoku apples"
- " Granulated sugar"
- " Water"
- " Rum"
- " Batter"
- " Butter"
- " Soft light brown sugar"
- " Eggs"
- " Milk"
- " Cake flour"
- " Baking powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring the butter and eggs for the batter to room temperature."
- "Make the caramelized apples: Peel and core the apples and cut into 16 wedges."
- "Put the apple slices in a heatproof container, sprinkle with lemon juice, and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave for 6 minutes at 500W, stirring the apples every 2 minutes."
- "Mix the granulated sugar and water together in a frying pan and heat on medium."
- "Cook while stirring occasionally with a wooden spatula until the sugar becomes caramale colored. Once it starts to color, it changes very quickly so be careful."
- "Add the apple slices with the juices (the caramel will splatter, so be careful). Add the rum also. Simmer over medium heat while making sure the caramel coats the apple slices evenly."
- "Mix occasionally so that the liquid coats the apples, until it&#39;s reduced to about 1 to 2 tablespoons or so."
- "Butter the cake pan, pour the liquid in first, then line the bottom with the apple slices. See steps 9 and 10 for how to layer the apple slices."
- "Combine 3 slices of apple and put in the middle. Place 6 slices around that, layering them on each other."
- "Keep layering the apple slices, overlapping them slightly. See the &#34;how to layer the apple slices&#34; instructions below."
- "Make the batter. Add the soft brown sugar to the softened butter, and cream together well."
- "Add the beaten eggs in 3 batches, mixing well each time so that the batter doesn&#39;t split between additions. Add the milk and mix well so that the batter doesn&#39;t split."
- "Sift the cake flour and baking powder together as you add them to the batter, and mix in completely."
- "Pour the batter into the cake pan over the apples, and level it out with a spatula. If you tap the pan (the usual method for leveling out cake batter) the layered apple slices will shift around."
- "Bake in a preheated 170°C oven for 35 to 40 minutes. If a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean, it&#39;s done."
- "Leave to cool in the cake tin. When it has cooled down a bit, place a board on top and flip it over to remove from the tin. Leave as is until the caramel has solidified."
- "Layer the apple slices, like this so that the top part of each slice will be on the surface when you turn the cake upside down."
- "This way of layering them is easier, but it doesn&#39;t look as nice since the core part of the top half of each slice will be hidden."

<i>Before you jump to Caramelized Apple Upside Down Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. Typically, all it requires is a little common sense.
