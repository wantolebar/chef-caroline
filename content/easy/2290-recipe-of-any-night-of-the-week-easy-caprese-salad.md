Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Probably the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
