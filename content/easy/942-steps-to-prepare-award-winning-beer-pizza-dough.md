<i>Before you jump to Beer pizza dough recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good an area to start as any. Complete this for the whole house, not merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more initially, these bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The kitchen lights especially are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This also occurs in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
