It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around.

The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
