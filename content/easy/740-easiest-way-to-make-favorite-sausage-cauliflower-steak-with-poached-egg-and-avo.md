<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
