recipeinstructions:
- "You can check out my previous vegan kimchi and vegan burger buns recipes."
- "Prepare the kimchi ketchup.  Blitz kimchi, ketchup, chili paste and maple syrup in a blender until smooth. Transfer into a bowl. Add nori flakes, lemon zest and juice. Mix until well combined. Taste and adjust for sweetness and spiciness. Set aside in the fridge until ready to use."
- "Prepare the Korean bbq sauce. In a bowl, add maple syrup, soy sauce, wine, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, mushroom powder and gochugaru. Mix until well combined. Add in scallion. Set aside until ready to use."
- "Prepare the burger. In a skillet over medium heat, drizzle some sesame oil. Once the oil is heated up, add in 2 patties. Add in the crushed garlic, 1/2&#34; ginger and 1 stalk of scallion. *You can crush them with a back of a knife.*"
- "Brush the patties with the bbq sauce. Cook until the bottom is crispy brown. Flip and brush the patties with some more bbq sauce. Baste the patties with all the liquid. Cook until the bottom is crispy brown. Remove from heat and set aside on a plate with all the crushed aromatics."
- "Brush the patties again with more bbq sauce. Repeat the steps for the remaining patties. *By cooking the patties in batches will prevent overcrowding of the skillet, which will create steam rather than searing and cooking.* Slice the mushroom lengthwise into 4 slices. You should have a total of 8 slices."
- "In the same skillet, drizzle some sesame oil. Place in the mushroom slices. Again, you can do this in batches. Brush the mushrooms with bbq sauce. Cook until the bottom is lightly caramelized. Flip and brush with more bbq sauce."
- "Slice burger buns into 3 tiers. Toast the buns in the same skillet. Once all the patties and mushrooms have been cooked, buns have been toasted, in the same skillet, pour in the remaining bbq sauce. Deglaze and reduce slightly until thick consistency. It should coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and transfer into a bowl."
- "Assemble the burger. Smear kimchi ketchup on the bottom buns. Add some kimchi over the top. Place the patties over the kimchi and drizzle some reduced bbq sauce over the top. Scatter some scallions."
- "Add on the 2nd tiers and smear on some more kimchi ketchup. Followed by 2 slices of mushrooms each. Drizzle some reduced bbq sauce over the top and some scallions. Close the top of the burger buns. Serve immediately."

<i>Before you jump to Vegan Korean BBQ Burger recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These kinds of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Why don't we begin with something quite simple, changing the actual light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more initially, these bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than simply swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This additionally occurs in the rest of the house, but we are trying to save money in the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
