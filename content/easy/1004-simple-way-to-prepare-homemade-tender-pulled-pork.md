recipeingredient:
- "8 lb Pork Butt Bonein"
- "1 tbsp Olive Oil"
- " Dry Rub"
- "1/4 cup Kosher Salt"
- "1 cup Lemon Pepper"
- "2 tbsp Sugar"
- "2 tbsp Turmeric Powder"
- "1 tbsp Paprika"
- "1 tsp Garlic Powder"
- "1 tsp Celery Salt"
- "1 tsp Garam Masala"
- "1 tsp Fennel Powder"
- "1/4 tsp Cayenne Powder"
- "1 dash White Pepper Powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Set up your grill for an indirect heat method. An insulated cooker such as The Akorn works well for this. Simply create a small pile of charcoal (roughly pyramid or cone shaped) interspersed with large chunks of hard wood. Place a fire starter under the top few pieces of charcoal and light. Close the lid and fully open all the vents. Give the charcoal 20 to 30 minutes to light. Throttle the top and bottom vents to barely open and allow the temperature to settle into the desired cooking range. This should take another 20 to 30 minutes. For this cook, get the grill around 300 to 325 Fahrenheit. This will reduce your cook time and give you a nice crust on the meat. However, you will not get as much smoke flavor on the meat."
- "Note: The Akorn has a smoke stone accessory that works great at creating a barrier between the meat and the heat, plus you can put an aluminum pan on it to catch the meat drippings to make clean up easy."
- "Thoroughly combine all the dry ingredients.   Note: Old plastic take out containers with lids work great for mixing and storing dry rubs. Simply add the ingredients to the container, cap, and shake."
- "Trim excess fat from the pork butt leaving about a quarter inch layer.   Note: Sam&#39;s Club sells trimmed pork butts in a 2 pack for a reasonable price. They are trimmed and ready for seasoning straight out of the package. Freeze the second butt for use later."
- "Rinse the butt with cold water and then pat dry with a paper towel. The surface of the meat needs to be as dry as possible."
- "Coat the meat with a very light coating of olive oil to help the the dry rub stick to the meat.   Note: Just about any oil will work for this or you can use yellow mustard if you prefer."
- "Sprinkle the meat with the dry rub and spread the  rub with your hands. The meat should be completely coated with a thin layer of rub."
- "Put the meat on the grill. Cook for 5 to 6 hours. Resist the urge to open the grill to look at the meat.  Monitor the grill temperature. Throttle the bottom vent as necessary to maintain between 300 to 325 Fahrenheit."
- "After about 5 hours check the meat. The best method for telling if the meat is done or not is to poke the meat with a skewer. If the skewer slides into the meat without any resistance (like cutting warm butter) the meat is done. Be sure to check several locations on the butt as different parts cook at different rates. Continuing cooking until done.   Note: The number one rule when it comes to BBQ is it&#39;s done when it&#39;s done. Meaning be patient."
- "When done, remove the meat from the grill. Set aside and lightly cover with foil and let rest for at least 30 minutes, preferably 1 hour.   Note:  Do not tightly wrap in foil as this will steam the outside and you will lose the some the crispy crust on the meat. Placing the meat in a disposable aluminum pan and covering with foil allows enough air space to prevent the steaming effect."
- "After the meat has rested, remove the bone. It should practically fall out on it&#39;s own. Pull the meat into long strands. Try not to eat all the crispy bits before you serve your family and guests. For a little extra zing, sprinkle a small amount of the dry rub onto the pulled meat and mix. A little bit goes a long way. Serve and enjoy.   CAUTION: The meat will still be extremely hot at this point."

<i>Before you jump to Tender Pulled Pork recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Drink water, not other drinks. Soda and coffee, when used in moderation, aren't that bad. It is definitely, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. Having water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to aid your body in its health and hydration. This also helps you decrease your caloric intake by hundreds of points without requiring you to buy and eat terrible diet foods. Productive weight loss efforts often depend solely on water intake.

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also critical. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. You need to help make your body as strong it can be.
