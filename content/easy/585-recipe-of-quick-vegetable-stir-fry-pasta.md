<i>Before you jump to Vegetable Stir Fry Pasta recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. Especially if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
