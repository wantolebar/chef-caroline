Dash with dried parsley and mix.   Open your jar of turkey gravy and place in a small microwavable bowl.  Vent your microwavable mash"
- "TO CONSTRUCT SANDWICHES If opting for cranberry sauce - smear toast with it. If not, place moist stuffing on toast. Lightly spoon drizzle gravy over the top of stuffing. Add turkey slices on top of stuffing. Scoop on mashed potatoes. Generously spoon drizzle tops with gravy. Sprinkle tops with black pepper. Garnish with fresh parsley. Serve hot buttered corn to the side."
- "Bam! Serve hot!   Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s Open Faced Turkey Sandwiches 4 2 N 10 recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some hints to be as healthful as possible.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an attempt on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are a whole lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It has more to do with making your body as sturdy as it can be.
