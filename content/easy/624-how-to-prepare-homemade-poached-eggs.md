<i>Before you jump to Poached Eggs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that difficult. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
