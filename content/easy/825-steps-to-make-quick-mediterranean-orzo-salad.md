According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically effective when it's full before a cycle is started. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that difficult. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
