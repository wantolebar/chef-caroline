Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements.

Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you should use them rather than incandescent lights. Although costing a little more initially, these bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Along with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed.
