<i>Before you jump to Protein shake (healthy) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. It's about being functional, more often than not.
