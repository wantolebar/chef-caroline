<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is basically using common sense.
