<i>Before you jump to Chicken Thai green curry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Typically, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
