recipeingredient:
- "90 grams Pancake mix"
- "10 grams Katakuriko"
- "1 less than 50 grams Silken tofu"
- "2 tsp Oil"
- "1 you can omit the oil Simplified version"
- "100 grams Pancake mix"
- "50 grams Silken tofu"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wrap the tofu in paper towels to absorb excess moisture. Cut the tofu to the pancake mix. If you are using oil, add the oil first, then add the tofu."
- "When the dough is evenly moist, bring it together in one mass by pressing down on the dough with your fist in the bowl."
- "Once the dough looks like the photo in Step 2, form it into a square shape and wrap it in a piece of plastic that&#39;s bigger than the 18 cm tart pan you will be using. Leave the dough to rest in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. (Make sure to cut the plastic wrap on the large side since it will be used later)."
- "Spread the plastic wrap out, and roll the dough out with a rolling pin on top of the plastic so that it fits the 18 cm diameter tart pan. Try to make the dough 1 mm thick."
- "You don&#39;t need to dust the rolling pin with flour, but if the dough sticks, dust with a little flour. If you roll the dough out to fit a 18 cm tart pan, the dough should be about 1.2 mm thick."
- "Oil the inside of the tart pan using your fingers. You can flour the pan during Step 5 too. The crust will come out cleanly this way."
- "Pick up the plastic wrap and invert the dough onto the tart pan. Press the crust into the pan over the plastic."
- "Remove excess crust using the rolling pin or your fingers as shown in the photo. You can do this with the plastic still on, or remove it. Whichever is easier for you."
- "Remove the excess crust, and slowly peel off the plastic wrap. Press the crust with your fingers so that it doesn&#39;t tear."
- "Pierce the bottom of the crust with a fork several times so that it doesn&#39;t bubble up."
- "Pre-bake the crust at 180°C for 10 to 15 minutes. If you have pie weights, put a piece of greased aluminium foil on the crust and the weights on top of that. I recommend tarts that don&#39;t require the crust to be pre-baked."
- "The crust is hard and tough to slice when it&#39;s freshly baked, but becomes easy to slice cleanly when cooled."
- "You can freeze the dough wrapped in plastic for about 1 week. De-frost naturally and roll it out."
- "Variation: 90 g pancake mix + 10 g katakuriko + 2 teaspoons oil. Although this version has oil, the result is a crispy crust that doesn&#39;t bubble up."

<i>Before you jump to Butter-free Ultra Healthy &amp; Easy Tart Crust recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is complete, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Consider the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about slimming down. It is more about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
