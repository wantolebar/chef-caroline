<i>Before you jump to Pineapple Chicken Adobo recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
