<i>Before you jump to Eggplant lasagna recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Run the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You need to help make your body as strong as possible.
