recipeingredient:
- " medium to large spaghetti squash"
- " lump crab meat"
- " finely chopped garlic"
- " finally diced sweet onion celery and green bell peppers trinity"
- " finally diced sweeties baby peppers red orange and yellow"
- " heavy cream"
- " Philadelphia whipped garlic and herb cream cheese"
- " Pecorino Romano or Parmasana Reggiano"
- " shredded cheese of choice ie Italian blend cheddar blend mozzarella etc"
- " Mrs Dash Original Salt and Pepper to Taste"
- " approximately olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Poke slits into the spaghetti squash to vent and place in microwave on high for 4-6 mins to soften it in preparation to cut it in half to make your boats. This makes slicing it in half much easier on the hands trust me."
- "Remove spaghetti squash from the microwave and when cool enough to the touch, cut the top stem off to flatten one end. Turn the spaghetti squash on it&#39;s top on the cut side and with a large chef&#39;s knife from the top cut down the middle to cut the spaghetti squash in half to form your boats. Using a large soup spoon scoop out the inner seeds and the flesh that it resides in."
- "Lightly oil the cut side of both boats and place them cut side down in a nonstick cookie sheet or roasting pan. Place in a preheated oven that has been preheated to 400 degrees F and roast the spaghetti squash for 40 mins. Once it is removed from oven, you can let it cool a bit or just using an oven mitt turn the boats over cut side up and fork up the inside flesh to form your spaghetti. Set aside while you make the sauce."
- "In a large sauté pan, heat about 1 Tbsp of olive oil on medium high heat."
- "Add your trinity, sweetie peppers and garlic to the pan and season with Mrs. Dash Original, salt and pepper to taste and sauté stirring often until the veggies become a bit translucent. Don&#39;t let them brown. Add your crab meat and once again season with Mrs. Dash Original, salt and pepper to taste. Go easy on the salt as you will be adding your parmesan cheese shortly. Just warm the crab through at this point as it&#39;s already cooked."
- "Add your heavy cream and garlic/herb cream cheese to melt it down then add your grated cheese of choice and stir to incorporate and warm through."
- "Pour your completed sauce mixture evenly over both boats. Don&#39;t bother stirring as it will seep down through the forked up flesh of the spaghetti squash. Sprinkle the shredded cheese of your choice on top of both boats."
- "In a preheated 350 degree F oven place the roasting pan with the completed boats uncovered and bake approximately 20-30 mins depending on how much browning you want on the top of the boats."
- "Serve immediately and enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Creamy Garlic Crab Spaghetti Squash Boats recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Choose water over other products. Sipping a soda or cup of coffee from time to time won't hurt you too badly. Getting most of your hydration from them is a awful idea. When you pick out water over other beverages you are helping your body stay very healthy and hydrated. This also helps you lower your caloric intake by hundreds of points without having to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Water is ordinarily one of the keys to really losing weight and leading a healthful lifestyle.

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your lifestyle choices. You need to make your body as strong as possible.
