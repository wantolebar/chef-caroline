recipeingredient:
- " Pork roast cooked in a Crockpot"
recipeinstructions:
- "SCRAMBLED EGGS AND PORK - Scramble up your eggs, add veggies, then add some pork as a fancy breakfast. Serve with toast or english muffin."
- "GRILLED CHEESE and PORK SANDWHICHS - make your usual grilled cheese sandwhiches and throw in some pork and caramelized onions for an elevated lunch or dinner. Serve that with soup or salad and have a scrumptious meal."
- "PORK and RICE - whether for lunch or dinner, not many things compare to a meat and rice dish. Whether you&#39;re using the rice cooker, making fried rice or opening the rice pilaf box, throw in some veggies on the side and have a delicious and healthy meal."
- "PORK SANWHICHES - a dinner that includes BBQ sauce and hamburger buns is sure to quiet the growling noises. Heat up some pork in a quart pot and add BBQ sauce. Once the pork is warmed, top that with coleslaw for flavor and crunch. For ultimate satisfaction, serve with side of mac n cheese or baked onion rings for a complete meal."
- "PORK and PASTA - I love pasta cooked on the stove top or baked in the oven. Next pasta dish you make, throw in some pork instead of ground beef/ turkey/chicken and be prepared to be satisfied."
- "PORK TACOS/ WRAP - warmed up pork topped with basic side items (sour cream,  avacado, salsa) stuffed in a tortilla served with a side salad and feel like a renergized person again. Plus, its super quick and satisfying."
- "PORK WONTONS OR EGG ROLLS - made this several times and it was delicious. If your not familiar with assembling wontons and currently have no desire to learn right now, buy a Grands biscuit container and stuff the individual biscuits with pork and cheese, then bake. It&#39;s no substitute to a pot sticker, but the point us that its something different. Flatten out the biscuit so it can hold some pork and cheese and shape likes mini calzones. Bake according to package directions."
- "EGG BAKED MUFFINS, QUICHE, OR CASSEROLE -  take your favorite recipe and substitute pork in place of other proteins. Cook as usual."
- "BELL PEPPER STUFFED PORK - seriously, what a great combo. Go crazy and stuff the heck out of those peppers. Instead of using rice, I like to substitute quinoa instead as I get a tendancy to get sleepy after eating this."
- "PORK TOPPED MASHED POTATOES WITH GRAVY- the only thing I have to say here is don&#39;t be suprised when you wake up drooling on yourself. Coma sleep is to be expected. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you."
- "PORK HOAGIE WITH AU JUS - instead of beef, add pork instead. Slap some mozzarella, swiss or cheddar on top and make some au jus to dip that in."
- "PIZZA - no I&#39;m not joking, its the bomb. Personally I like to use BBQ sauce, cilantro, cheese, red onions and red pepper flakes. So good and delicious."
- "ENCHILLADAS - alright, if you didn&#39;t make this for dinner initially then take care of business. There aren&#39;t many pork enchillada recipes on this site, but no worries. Just replace the chicken or beef from an existing recipe and prepare for your family to drool until dinner is served."
- "RAMEN PORK - you know you want to do it. Cook ramen according to the package and add whatever you want. If you love ramen then you&#39;ll enjoy this for sure."
- "PORK NACHOS - give your nachos a protein boost. Heat up some shredded pork and evenly distribute over chips."
- "These are my go to recipes. I know there are many more uses for pork found in ethnic recipes, but I don&#39;t cook those dishes so easily. I plan on expanding my leftover pork recipes as I move forward into the future, but for now here are the most basic, tastiest, and simplest recipes I use. Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Uses for leftover pulled pork recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Preserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's related to being functional, usually.
