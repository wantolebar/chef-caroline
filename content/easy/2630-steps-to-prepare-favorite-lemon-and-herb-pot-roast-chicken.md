<i>Before you jump to Lemon and Herb Pot Roast Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. It's related to being sensible, more often than not.
