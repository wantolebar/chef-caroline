<i>Before you jump to Green onion sabji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
