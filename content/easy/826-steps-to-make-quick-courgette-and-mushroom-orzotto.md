It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply utilizing common sense.
