<i>Before you jump to Fava Beans and Olives recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is done, most people do not wish to go to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Consider the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your healthfulness. You need to help make your body as strong as possible.
