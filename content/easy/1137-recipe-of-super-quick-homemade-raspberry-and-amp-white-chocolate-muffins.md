That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently.
