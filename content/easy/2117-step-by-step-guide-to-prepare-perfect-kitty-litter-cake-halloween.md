<i>Before you jump to Kitty Litter Cake ~ halloween recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as effectively as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that tough. It's concerning being functional, more often than not.
