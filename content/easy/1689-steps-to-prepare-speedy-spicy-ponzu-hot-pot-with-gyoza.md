<i>Before you jump to Spicy Ponzu Hot Pot with Gyoza recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
