Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many individuals wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
