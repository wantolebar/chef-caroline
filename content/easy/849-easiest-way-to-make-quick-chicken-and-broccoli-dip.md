<i>Before you jump to Chicken and Broccoli Dip recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many men and women wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is started. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not that difficult. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
