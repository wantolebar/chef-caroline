<i>Before you jump to Apple Tea Jam recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as effectively as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
