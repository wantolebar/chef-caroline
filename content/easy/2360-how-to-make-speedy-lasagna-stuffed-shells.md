<i>Before you jump to Lasagna stuffed shells recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Consider the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get wholesome. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done each day, can do plenty to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the choices you make each day is a start. Trying to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Don't overlook that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It has more to do with making your body as strong as it can be.
