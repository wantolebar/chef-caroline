recipeingredient:
- " bamboo skewers soaked in water for at least an hour"
- " boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into roughly 15inch cubes to the extent that you can cut chicken thigh meat into cubes which is to say not really"
- " minced garlic about 3 cloves"
- " minced fresh ginger root or you could use about 14 teaspoon dry ginger powder"
- " green onion finely chopped"
- " sugar"
- " gochujang Korean red chili paste You can substitute with sriracha  not quite the same but youll get a tasty result"
- " low sodium soy sauce"
- " kosher salt"
- " neutral oil like vegetable canola grapeseed"
- " large onion cut into 1 pieces for skewering and tossed with 2 teaspoonfuls of oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, mix together all the ingredients except the onion, making sure to incorporate all of them thoroughly."
- "Cover the bowl and set in the fridge to marinate (about 1 hour ideally, and not more than 2). Remember to take the meat out of the fridge about 30 minutes before you&#39;re ready to grill.  If you&#39;re using a charcoal grill, start your coals about 20 to 25 minutes before you want to grill. You want a gentle, medium low heat over which to cook these kebabs.  If gas, just pre-heat your grill to medium low 5 to 7 minutes before cooking."
- "Skewer your kabobs so they look like this.  6 single layers of onion with 5 roughly 1&#34;layers of chicken skewered between them. As you&#39;ve probably discovered by now, it&#39;s a little challenging to get 1&#34; cubes of meat from chicken thighs, but you generally want a 1&#34; thickness of meat between veg, so you might have to add odd pieces of chicken to the bigger ones to achieve this thickness.  I used only onions mostly because I think it tastes simple and delicious this way."
- "Over a medium low grill, cook the kebabs about 15 minutes, covered, turning them every 5 minutes."
- "Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Dak Bulgogi (Korean Style Spicy Chicken) Kabobs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Run the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are a whole lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the decisions you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. It has more to do with making your body as sturdy as it can be.
