<i>Before you jump to Protein Rich Energy Bar No Bake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you make certain the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
