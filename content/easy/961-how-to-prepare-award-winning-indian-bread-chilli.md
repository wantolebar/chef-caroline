Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. A lot of it is basically making use of common sense.
