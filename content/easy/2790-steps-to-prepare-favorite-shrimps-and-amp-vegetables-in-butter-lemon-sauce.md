Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet.

These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as economically as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.
