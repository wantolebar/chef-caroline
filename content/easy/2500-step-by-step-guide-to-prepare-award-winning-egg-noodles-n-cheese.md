Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time.
