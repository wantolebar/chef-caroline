Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a spot to start as any. Accomplish this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, after all. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
