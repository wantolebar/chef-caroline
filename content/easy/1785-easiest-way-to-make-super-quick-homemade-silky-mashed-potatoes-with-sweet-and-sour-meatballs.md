<i>Before you jump to Silky mashed potatoes with sweet and sour meatballs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is definitely not true. Particularly if you make certain the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that hard. It's related to being sensible, usually.
