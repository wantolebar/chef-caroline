<i>Before you jump to Easter Chowder recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Let's begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. You really need to upgrade your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll usually discover members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in different rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and discover exactly how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
