It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as economically as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.
