<i>Before you jump to My Family&#39;s Easy Hand-Rolled Sushi with Inexpensive Fillings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as efficiently as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
