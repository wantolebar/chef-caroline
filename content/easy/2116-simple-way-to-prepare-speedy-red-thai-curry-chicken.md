They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Making use of these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed.
