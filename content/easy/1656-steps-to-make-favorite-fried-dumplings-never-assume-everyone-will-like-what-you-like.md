Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a place to begin with as any. Do this for the entire house, not only the kitchen. You should change your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more originally, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to acquire the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently come across members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house as well. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not that difficult. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
