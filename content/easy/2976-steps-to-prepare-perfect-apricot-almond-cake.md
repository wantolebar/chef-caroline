Changing light bulbs is as good an area get started on as any. This will go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a little bit more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Along with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed.
