You really need to replace your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good.

In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed.

Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.
