- "1 Chocolate bar milk or dark"
- "40 grams Butter or margarine"
- "50 ml Milk"
- "2 Eggs"
- "50 grams Sugar"
- "100 grams Pancake mix"
- "50 grams Cocoa powder with sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave (about a minute). Let it cool down a little, then add the milk and mix."
- "Beat the 2 eggs and sugar together, just until it&#39;s foamy, as shown in this photo."
- "Combine the Step 1 and Step 2 mixtures together."
- "Add the pancake mix and cocoa powder (no need to sift them)! Mix well. It&#39;s best to crush any lumps, but if a few remain it&#39;s not a big deal."
- "The batter will be thick, creamy and bouncy like this."
- "Butter the bowl of your rice cooker with margarine (not listed in the ingredients) using your fingers and pour in the Step 5 batter. Switch the rice cooker on! (In the same way you would cook white rice.)"
- "When the cake is done, if a bamboo skewer stuck in the middle comes out clean, transfer the cake to a dish. If some batter sticks to the skewer, cook for another 15 minutes or so."
- "Done! It looks like this when sliced. It&#39;s moist, but still sponge-like and delicious."
- "If the cake doesn&#39;t get cooked no matter how many times you switch your rice cooker on, try one of these methods: Bake in the oven in the rice cooker bowl; take the cake out of the bowl and finish baking it in a frying pan. You can also finish cooking it up in a microwave as well."

<i>Before you jump to Ultra Easy Chocolate Cake in a Rice Cooker recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
