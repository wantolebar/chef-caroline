recipeingredient:
- "3 Corn on the cob"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "300 ml Water"
- "1 Note Cook as much corn as you like as long as they fit into the pan without overlapping"
recipeinstructions:
- "Shuck the corn and rinse."
- "Break the corn to fit into your saucepan."
- "Place the corn in the saucepan with a cup of water (only one). The key is not to immerse the corn entirely. Sprinkle in a tiny pinch of salt."
- "Cover with a lid. Cook over high for 3 minutes."
- "If desired, turn over the pieces, and boil for about 1 more minute. It&#39;s not necessary to cover the pot here. To drain, slide the lid to drain out the small amount of water remaining. No need to use a strainer."
- "Remove the lid, and the corn should be a beautiful, shiny golden yellow. Plate quickly and enjoy!"
- "That&#39;s all there is to it. This corn should be completely boiled to perfection. They are truly sweet and delicious prepared this way."
- "If you buy a large amount of corn-on-the-cob, boil them right away, double-wrap them in plastic wrap, then freeze to store. Corn is best in the summer, when it&#39;s in season. We like having ours with bread and soup, or topping it on pizza!"
- "I also posted how to fold a box for disposing vegetable scraps at the table. When you have spare time, fold them from the ad pages in your newspaper, and use them to toss edamame shells, corn scarps, etc."
- "I made my first corn-on-the-cob of the season."
- "If you have any leftovers, wrap them in aluminium foil, and store them in the refrigerator. After a few days, you can grill them in the foil on your grill or oven grill with soy sauce drizzled on top for a grilled corn-on-the-cob. The sweet aroma is delightful!"

<i>Before you jump to Perfect 3-Minute Corn-on-the-Cob recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle involves. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Pick water over other refreshments. Soda and coffee, when used in moderation, aren't that bad. Getting all your hydration from them is a horrendous idea. Choosing water as an alternative to other beverage adds to your body's health and allows it stay hydrated. This also helps you lower your caloric intake by hundreds of points without having to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Successful weight loss efforts often depend entirely on water consumption.

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthful isnâ€™t just about losing weight. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
