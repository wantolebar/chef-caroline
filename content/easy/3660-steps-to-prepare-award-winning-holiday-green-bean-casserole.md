<i>Before you jump to Holiday Green Bean Casserole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Let's begin with something quite simple, changing the actual light bulbs. Accomplish this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you should use them rather than incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. You also have to acquire the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The kitchen lights especially are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house as well. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
