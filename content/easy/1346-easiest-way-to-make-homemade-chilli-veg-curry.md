<i>Before you jump to Chilli veg curry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as efficiently as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
