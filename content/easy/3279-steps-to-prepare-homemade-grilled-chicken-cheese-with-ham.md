recipeinstructions:
- "Heat gas or charcoal grill. Cut 4 (18x12-inch) sheets of heavy-duty foil. Spray with cooking spray."

For each breast, cut 1 slice of cheese in half, and add to pocket; cut 1 slice ham in half, and add to pocket. Secure with toothpicks. In small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of the mustard, the Worcestershire sauce and smoked paprika. Brush chicken breasts with Dijon mixture."

<i>Before you jump to Grilled chicken cheese with ham recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.

When you go to the grocery store, be smart about it. Making good decisions when shopping for food means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. Think for a second: you don't want to go to a chaotic grocery store or sit in a long line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to go home and make a little something from your kitchen. Make sure that what you have on hand is healthy. This way—even if you choose something a bit greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still choosing foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need to make your body as strong it can be.
