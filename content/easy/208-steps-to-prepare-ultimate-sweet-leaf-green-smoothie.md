Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution.

Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as effectively as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, of course. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
