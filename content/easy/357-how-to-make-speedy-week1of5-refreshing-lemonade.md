<i>Before you jump to #Week1of5 Refreshing Lemonade recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is complete, most people do not wish to go to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Climb stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a good deal of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done every single day, can do plenty to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the decisions you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
