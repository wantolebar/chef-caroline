<i>Before you jump to Bitter Melon Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is done, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Take the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? Most people will decide to be idle and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are a whole lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done each day, can do a lot to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You want your body to be powerful too.
