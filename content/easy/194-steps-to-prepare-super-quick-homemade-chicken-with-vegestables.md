<i>Before you jump to Chicken with vegestables recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Let us begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. This will probably go further than the kitchen, nonetheless that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a little bit more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. You also have to obtain the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The kitchen lights specifically will often be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house also. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
