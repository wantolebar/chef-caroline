<i>Before you jump to Carrot juice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

You may possibly prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. It's concerning being sensible, more often than not.
