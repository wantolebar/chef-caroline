Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Accomplish this for your house, not only the kitchen. You really need to upgrade your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The kitchen lights especially tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This likewise takes place in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.
