<i>Before you jump to Hasselback Potatoes (easy diet version) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
