<i>Before you jump to Vickys Bananas Foster Tarte Tatin, GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.

Run the stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You really want your body to be strong too.
