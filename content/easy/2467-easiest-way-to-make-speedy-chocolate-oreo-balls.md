<i>Before you jump to Chocolate Oreo Balls recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Consider the stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Looking to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You need your body to be powerful too.
