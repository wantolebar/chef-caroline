<i>Before you jump to Spinach and Tomato Poached Eggs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Why don't we begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. This will go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you will need to use them rather than incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than simply swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. It's related to being sensible, usually.
