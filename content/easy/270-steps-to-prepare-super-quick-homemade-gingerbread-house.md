<i>Before you jump to Gingerbread house recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being functional, usually.
