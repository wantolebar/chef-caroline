<i>Before you jump to Sushi Rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is as good an area to start as any. Accomplish this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than simply replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. This also happens in the rest of the house, but we are trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
