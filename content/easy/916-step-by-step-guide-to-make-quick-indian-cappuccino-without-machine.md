<i>Before you jump to INDIAN CAPPUCCINO-without machine recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Why don't we begin with something not that hard, changing the particular light bulbs. This will certainly go beyond the kitchen, nevertheless that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them in place of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Obviously this also happens in some other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
