recipeinstructions:
- "Chop the carrot, and slice the onion, garlic, and celery. I am a big fan of celery leaves because they are intensely flavored... so I add some as a bonus."

<i>Before you jump to Fridge-Clearing Shrimp Bisque recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

Pick water over other drinks. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every now and then isn’t a terrible idea. It is, however, a bad idea to only drink soda or coffee. When you choose water over other beverages you are helping your body stay very healthful and hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories from your diet— without having to resort to terrible tasting diet food. Water is often one of the keys to successful weight reduction and healthfulness.

There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also important. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. You need your body to be strong too.
