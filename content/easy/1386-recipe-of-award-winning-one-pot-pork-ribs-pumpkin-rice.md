<i>Before you jump to 一锅煮金瓜排骨饭 One-Pot Pork Ribs Pumpkin Rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
