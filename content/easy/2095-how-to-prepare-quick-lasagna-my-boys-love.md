recipeinstructions:
- "Dice the carrot, celery and red onion. Saute them in the oil for 5 mins. Add the garlic, tomato paste and sage. When softened add the pork mince to brown."
- "Put the oven on to 220° to heat up whilst you prepare the other parts."
- "When the mince is brown add the pasata and bring to the boil. Then turn down to a low slow simmer for about 25 mins."
- "In a separate pan- snip the bacon in and fry it off. Then add the spinach to wilt in the pan and coat in the bacon fat. Once its wilted let it cool a little and mix it in a bowl with the ricotta and a couple of spoons of grated parmesan."
- "Then in a third pan melt the butter and stir in the flour. Cook the roux for a few minutes and whisk in the milk to make a bechamel. Season this with black pepper and nutmeg. Keep stirring until it thickens."
- "Place the lasagna dish (oven proof) on a baking sheet. Then add the first layer of meat sauce. Follow by a layer of pasta. Then add the spinach ricotta layer and more pasta. Then more meat sauce and a final layer of pasta. Pour the bechamel on top and lift it into the oven (the tray catches any stray bits that bubble up and stops it dripping down to the oven floor to burn and give you a nasty oven to clean)."
- "Keep it baking for about 30 mins then lift it out. Sprinkle over grated cheddar and put back in for another 15 mins."
- "Serve alone or with a crisp salad. The day wasn&#39;t so bad after all."

<i>Before you jump to Lasagna my boys love recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. It's about being functional, more often than not.
