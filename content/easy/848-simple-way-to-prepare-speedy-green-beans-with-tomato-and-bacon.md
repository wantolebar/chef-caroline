<i>Before you jump to Green beans with tomato and bacon recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Especially if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
