Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Maybe the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen alone offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that tough. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
