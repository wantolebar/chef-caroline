recipeinstructions:
- "Start off with making the Hollandaise: melt butter on a small saucepan over low heat. Once melted, remove from stove and let stand for 5 minutes. Then clarify the butter.( one method is to skim the foam from the top, and slowly pour into a container, discard the milky solids in the bottom of the pan). Clarifying butted gives it a higher smoke point. Once done set the butter aside"
- "Place shallots, wine, vinegar, bay leaf and two dashes of black pepper in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce by two thirds. Remove the saucepan from the heat once reduced and allow to cool."
- "Now, place a saucepan of water over medium-low heat and bring to a simmer."
- "Meanwhile the water comes up to a simmer. Add the three egg yolks into a heat resistant bowl with a tablespoon of water and a full tablespoon of the shallot reduction, whisk all together until foamy.(if taste of the shallots isn&#39;t too strong you can add more. Leftover shallot reduction can be stored in the fridge for up to 4 days)"
- "Once the water starts to simmer and the egg yolks are foamy, set the bowl on the pan and continue whisking until the mix forms a thick ribbon, when you lift the whisk from the bowl, be careful not to scramble the sauce."
- "Slowly and in a steady stream, pour in the clarify butter into the sauce, whisking constantly. Strain the sauce through a sieve into a dish. Stir in the basil and season to taste. Set aside and keep warm."
- "(Don&#39;t toss out the water in the saucepan, you can use it for when you poach the eggs)"
- "Now move onto the hash: begin with heating up the coconut oil on a large skilled at medium high heat. Carefully, add in the diced sweet potato, and cook for about 10 min, or until sides are lightly browned."
- "Meanwhile, get a small bowl and mix all the spices(paprika,cayenne, garlic, and Italian seasoning) together. Add the mix of spices and mini bell peppers to the sweet potatoes once they start browning in the skillet."
- "Once all sides of the sweet potatoes are lightly browned add the chopped spinach and give it a few tosses until wilted. 2-3 min."
- "Final step poach eggs: Reheat the water in the saucepan on high heat(the water that you had brought up to a simmer while making the sauce). Add the dash of vinegar and the sea salt to the water and once it starts boiling with a fork, spoon or knife, stir the water until you create a whirlpool then one by one toss in the eggs. Cap the saucepan, turn off the stove and let the pan stand for 5 min without lifting the cap. Then take the eggs out, set them on a paper towel for minute and then place them on top of the hash and top off with the hollandaise."

<i>Before you jump to Poached Egg with Hollandaise Sauce and Sweet Potato Spinach Hash recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

Drink water, not other drinks. Sipping a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. Using them for your only source of hydration, conversely, is dumb. Drinking water instead of other kinds of drinks is a good way to aid your body in its health and hydration. This also helps you reduce your caloric intake by hundreds of points without needing to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Successful weight loss efforts often depend exclusively on water ingestion.

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being clever when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Wanting to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
