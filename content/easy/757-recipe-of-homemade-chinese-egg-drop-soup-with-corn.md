<i>Before you jump to Chinese Egg-drop Soup with Corn recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Maybe the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
