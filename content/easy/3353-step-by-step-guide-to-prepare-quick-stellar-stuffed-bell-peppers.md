recipeingredient:
- "1 cup dry instant rice 2 cups when prepared"
- "3 large bell peppers  any color we like red for these"
- "1 lb lean ground beef lighter option ground turkey"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 small yellow onion  finely chopped"
- "2 tbsp finely chopped bell pepper"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/4 tsp ground black pepper"
- "1 tsp dry oregano"
- "1/2 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 can condensed tomato soup"
- "1 dash cayenne pepper"
- "3 slice cheese of your choice we like Colby Jack or pepper jack"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare instant rice to package directions. When done set aside for later."
- "Bring a large pot of water to a boil, make sure water is deep enough to cover peppers. This is to parboil  your peppers which helps get them nice and soft in the oven, without becoming mushy or overcooking the filling."
- "While waiting on water to boil cut tops off peppers. Use tops (without stems) to chop and reserve 2tbs for later. Remove seeds and clean up insides of peppers. If your peppers can&#39;t &#34;stand up straight&#34; trim the bottoms just enough to create a flat surface without cutting a hole through the bottom. Then, fill a large bowl with ice and water (this is their &#34;ice bath&#34;)."
- "Gently place peppers in boiling water, submerging completely. Let boil for 1-2 minutes. Gently use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove peppers from boiling water, allowing excess water to drain back into pot, and transfer to the prepared ice bath immediately, submerging completely, to stop the cooking process."
- "Remove peppers from ice bath. Set aside upside down on paper towels to drain. Meanwhile preheat your oven to 375°F and make your filling."
- "Heat a large sauce pan over medium heat (to save dishes I just use the pot I boil the peppers in even though it&#39;s a little bigger than needed). Add 1 tablespoon oil, chopped peppers and chopped onion. Cook until just tender, about 2 minutes."
- "Add ground beef, salt and pepper to pot. Brown ground beef, breaking up into fine pieces while cooking. When cooked through, turn off heat, drain in colander (do not rinse) and return to pan."
- "Stir into meat the dry oregano, garlic powder, can of tomato soup and cayenne pepper. Mix until incorporated then gently fold in cooked rice. Taste mixture and adjust salt and pepper to taste."
- "Place bell peppers in a casserole dish open end up. Fill each to &#34;heaping&#34; with meat and rice mixture, packing it into the cavity as you go."
- "Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove from oven, place one slice of cheese on top of each pepper and return to oven for 5-10 minutes more or until cheese is melted. Remove from oven and let rest for 5-10 minutes."
- "Alteration: Swap the cheese for a swirl of ketchup covering the tops for a dairy free option! Put this on BEFORE baking and extend time to 25-30 minutes (the total time you would bake when using cheese)."

<i>Before you jump to Stellar Stuffed Bell Peppers recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Consider the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get wholesome. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
