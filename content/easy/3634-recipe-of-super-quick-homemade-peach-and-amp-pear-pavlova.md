- " For the cream"
- "1 carton whipping cream"

recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 150C/130C fan assisted and lay parchment paper on oiled try (or use meringue mix in corners to stick sheet to tray)."
- "Mix egg whites at high speed until foamy and cloudy. Then add 1 tbsp caster sugar at a time until soft peaks form and all sugar dissolved. When whisking the sugar in, turn down to medium initially so you don&#39;t get soft peaks before all sugar has dissolved."
- "Lower speed and then mix cornflour and vinegar and add. Also add vanilla essence and whisk all through the meringue mix."
- "Spread meringue mixture onto greaseproof paper and spread out but ensure middle not higher than outsides. This way maximizes the portions available by spreading across all of the baking tray. Put meringue in oven for 30 minutes then turn down to 90 degrees for 90 minutes. Turn oven off and allow to cool in oven for 1-2 hours. Take out and allow to cool for further 1 hour before removing from baking tray."
- "Lightly whisk cream and add sugar if required. I use 2 tbsps. Spread cream on pavlova and arrange fruit of your choice then crumble a Cadburys Flake on top."

<i>Before you jump to Peach &amp; Pear Pavlova recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

Make smart choices when shopping for groceries. When you make wise choices at the grocery store, your meals will get healthier automatically. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with packed grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You’re going to go home and cook what you already have. Make sure that what you have on hand is healthful. This way—even if you choose something a bit greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still selecting foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the selections you make each day is a start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Don't overlook that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You really want your body to be powerful too.
