<i>Before you jump to BBQ Asian Chicken Thighs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as economically as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to operate as often.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
