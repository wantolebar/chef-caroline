Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Probably the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, of course. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
