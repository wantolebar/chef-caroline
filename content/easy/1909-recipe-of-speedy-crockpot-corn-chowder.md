<i>Before you jump to Crockpot Corn Chowder recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
