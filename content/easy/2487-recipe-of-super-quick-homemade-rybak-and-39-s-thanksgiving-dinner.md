<i>Before you jump to Rybak&#39;s Thanksgiving dinner recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that hard. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
