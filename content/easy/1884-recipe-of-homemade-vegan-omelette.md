recipeingredient:
- "1,5 cups Chickpea Flour 375 ml"
- "5 ml Black Salt or Herb Salt"
- "2.5 ml Tumeric"
- "5 ml Hing garlic onion alternative"
- "1.5 Cups Water 375 ml"
- "1 cup Packed Cauliflower Rice"
- "2 Bunches Asparagus about 20 spears"
- "5 ml Lemon Juice"
- " Black Pepper optional seasoning"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place dry ingredients in a bowl and add water bit by bit while stirring with a wire wisk. Next stir in the cauliflower (about two cups of cauliflower florets, washed and blended in food processor or grated finely by hand)."
- "Wash the asparagus and chop the bottom two thirds of the stems into thin slices. Sauté in a bit of coconut oil. Add 30 ml water and cover with lid, stirring occasionally. Add the asparagus tips which you kept whole. Continue to sauté until tender yet firm. Add lemon juice."
- "Pour a thin layer of the batter into a hot pan. Reduce heat. Dedvide topping into the amount of portions you wish to cook. Add topping for each omelette on top."
- "Cook for a few minutes until you are able to slide a spatula under the omlette and flip over. Cook on the other side until golden brown."
- "Flip over again to serve with topping on top. Season to taste with black pepper and some herb salt. Repeat for every omlette. The runnier your batter, the thinner the omlette will be and the longer it is cooked on low heat the crispier it will become. So play around with consistency and temperature until it is ideal for your taste. Serve with home made tomatoe sauce. Enjoy!"
- "Alternatively you can top your omlette (pancake) with raw vegetables after it has been cooked on both sides. Avo tomatoe slices and baby spinach works well."

<i>Before you jump to Vegan Omelette recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle involves. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

Take the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. You want your body to be strong too.
