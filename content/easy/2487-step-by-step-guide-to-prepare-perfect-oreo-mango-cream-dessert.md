<i>Before you jump to Oreo mango cream Dessert recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
