recipeinstructions:

- "Preparing the white sauce :Heat oil and butter in a pan, add flour and roast it unless you get a nice aroma and a little golden colour. Slowly add in the milk and continuously whisk it, so that no lumps are formed. Once nicely mixed, boil it. As soon as it starts thickening up add in the cheese, pepper, salt and herbs (If adding). If you get lumps in your sauce, no need to worry just pass it through a sieve and it will be fine. Cook it unless you get a desired consistency."
- "Roasting the vegetables: Heat oil in a pan, add in garlic and saute. Once done, add in the onions and saute until translucent. Then add in the rest of the veggies - mushrooms, spinach, bell peppers and broccoli (I used frozen broccoli hence added in the end but if you are using fresh, just add in with the rest veggies). Also add in the chilli flakes, basil and salt. Mix everything and let it cook unless all the moisture dries out."
- "Layering: For layering, take a pan and grease with some oil (I used porcelain 9&#34;x 6&#34; dish, you can use cake tin also) Pour in a little red sauce and spread, then layer the pasta sheets tightly and compact.  Spread some roasted veggies and spread. Then pour in some white sauce and again spread. Finally spread in some cheese. Repeat the layering process thrice."
- "Baking :Once done with the layering, cover the pan with an aluminum foil and bake it in a preheated oven at 180째C for first 20 minutes, then take out the aluminum foil and again bake for 15 minutes. If you want your cheese to be a little brown just broil it for 1 minute at 230째C (Pleas don&#39;t move away during broiling)  Once done, let it cool for 15 minutes and then cut a slice and Enjoy!"

<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
