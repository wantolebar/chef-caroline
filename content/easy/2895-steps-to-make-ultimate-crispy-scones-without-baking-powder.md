recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 200℃. Put the ★ ingredients into a plastic bag."
- "Let some air inside, and shake the bag to mix together."
- "Then add the margarine. Mash it to coat the margarine with flour."
- "When there are few lumps, massage the mixture in the bag with both hands to make a sandy texture."

- "Tear the dough into suitable sizes to shape the round balls. But do not knead nor roll it."
- "Rough surfaces make for a delicious texture. You don&#39;t have to worry too much about chunks of margarine that haven&#39;t been mixed in completely."
- "Bake for 22 minutes in a 200℃ preheated oven. When they become light brown, they are done. Adjust the cooking time depending on your oven."
- "They are delicious as is, but I prefer to serve them with heavy cream and apple jam."
- "If you add chocolate or dried fruits, add them in Step 4, then shake to mix together and add the egg mixture."
- "Of course, you don&#39;t have to use a plastic bag."
- "Adjust the amount of egg mixture, depending on the type of margarine and room temperature. For me, 70 ml is the best."

<i>Before you jump to Crispy Scones without Baking Powder recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Run the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get wholesome. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also critical. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your healthfulness. It is more about making your body as strong as it can be.
