recipeingredient:
- "175 g very soft butter"
- "175 g golden caster sugar"
- "140 g selfraising flour"
- "50 g ground almonds"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "3 medium eggs"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/4 tsp almond extract"
- " Pink food colouring"
- "4 Tbsp fresh milk"
- " Jam as required"
- "1 Marzipan block"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line the base and sides of a 20cm square tin with baking parchment (the easiest way is to cross 2 x 20cm-long strips over the base see in pics)To make the sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract and 4tbsp milk in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly."
- "Divide better equal into 2 bowls and add pink food colour in one bowl and mix well. Then pour both better in cake tin separately and bake for 25-30 mins ‚Äì when you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling"
- "üåªTo assemble:  heat the jam in a small pan until runny, trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, (see in pics) then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake."
- "Take 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick."
- "Brush with jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, (see in pics) brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes."
- "Carefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork). If you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork."
- "Assemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days. Can be frozen for up to a month. Enjoy !!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

<i>Before you jump to Battenberg cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Perhaps the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. As soon as you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
