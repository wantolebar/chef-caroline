<i>Before you jump to Jaime&#39;s Classic Meatloaf recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a spot to begin with as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you will need to use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more initially, these bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house as well. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see how much electricity you can save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that tough. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
