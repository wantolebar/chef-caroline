<i>Before you jump to Sweet Chowder recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Let us begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. This will certainly go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
