<i>Before you jump to Mashed &amp; Baked - Sweet Potatoes &amp; Apples recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of electrical power is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty straightforward to live green, all things considered. It's about being functional, most of the time.
