The typical light bulbs are the incandescent type, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a little bit more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. You also have to acquire the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. The kitchen lights in particular will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there.
