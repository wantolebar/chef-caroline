- "Using a wooden spoon, stir in 1 3/4 cup of the cilantro, reserving about 1/2 cup for serving."
- "Serve in bowls topped with the feta cheese (if you wish) and fresh cilantro. **Important safety tip** Let the batch of chili cool down to lukewarm - up to 90 minutes after cooking - before putting it in the refridgerator. This will keep the inside of your fridge at the proper temperature for safe food storage."
