recipeingredient:
- "300 g Arborio rice"
- "200 g mix of mozzarella and pecorino cheese cubed"
- "50 g grated Parmesan"
- "2 beaten eggs"
- " Plain flour"
- " Breadcrumbs  Panko are good"
- " Rapeseed oil for frying"
- "50 g butter cubed"
- " Salt  Pepper"
- "Pinch English mustard powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat oven to 220C Cook the rice in boiling water for 12 minutes until al dente. Do not stir as you would a risotto, as you want the starch to help keep the rice ‘sticky’. Drain the rice and leave to cool – spread flat on baking parchment on a baking tray. Mix the mozzarella, mustard powder, Parmesan and pepper."
- "Divide rice into 8 equal-sized amounts. Keep a bowl of water nearby and wet your hands. Take a bit of rice and mould it in the cup of your other hand (about 2cm thick). Place some of the cheese mix and one cube of butter in the centre and close your hand to make a ball, filling in with extra rice as needed. Once all the filling is no longer exposed you can gently shape the ball. Repeat with the remaining rice until you have 8 balls / 16 canapé-sized balls."
- "Season beaten eggs with salt and pepper and gently roll the ball first in seasoned flour, then in the egg wash. Next coat the balls in breadcrumbs."
- "Heat oil to 170C and deep fry arancini in batches until golden. Warm in oven for 8-10 minutes to be sure you have a nice, gooey melting middle and serve immediately."
- "When you feel confident you can experiment with all different combinations. In Pisa I saw amazing ones with squid ink risotto and prawn fillings"
- "Arancini con Asparagi e Porcini is a rich, satisfying vegetarian option made with wild mushrooms and asparagus. Fusion varieties are also possible: my Thai Prawn Arancini fused squid ink risotto with spicy Thai red curry filling served with a sweet chilli dipping sauce, it is delicious but would be heartily disapproved of in my home country!"
- "Il Ambassadore is a sweet Arancini made with a melting chocolate and hazelnut filling, like a Ferrero Rocher!"
