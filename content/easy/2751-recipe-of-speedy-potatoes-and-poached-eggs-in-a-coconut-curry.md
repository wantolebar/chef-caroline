When the potatoes and squash are cooked through, it will be time for the eggs to go in. Simmer on medium-low heat for 10-15mins and allow the potatoes and squash to cook through"
- "Test a potato in the pot and if it feels cooked (soft and mushy), if it is, break the eggs one by one into the pot. Do it slow and make sure the eggs don&#39;t break. It might sound tricky but it was not that difficult!"
- "Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a lid. Cook for 5mins until the yolk is cooked. I cooked till I got a firm yolk, if you want a runny yolk it should take less than 5mins. Once done, allow the curry to rest for a few minutes before serving"
