recipeingredient:
- "3 Tbsp. Butter"
- "1/4 cup flour"
- "1/2 cup milk halfand half OR heavy cream"
- "1 cup cooked chicken minced"
- "1 can (14 oz.) chicken broth"
- "1/4 cup chopped mushrooms"
- "Pinch dried Thyme optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "You can successfully make this soup in less than 10 minutes from pantry items and a couple refrigerated stables... Start by melting 3 tablespoons butter over a medium heat. Once melted sprinkle with 1/4 cup flour and whisk until smooth. This is going to be a roux not a gravy, so take it easy with measuring the flour, no heaping or packing here."
- "Once the flour has absorbed the butter add the milk. Whisk, whisk, whisk. Once the roux thickens add the chicken broth, and you guessed it, whisk."
- "Now because everything else we are adding is cooked and just needs to be brought up to temperature turn the heat to medium-low. Add the minced chicken (this can be canned, rotisserie, leftover, white meat, dark meat, chicken you cooked just because you wanted to make soup... Chicken). Then add the chopped mushrooms. I like using the ugly little canned mushrooms for this soup because it keeps soup prep to less than ten minutes. Stir! You thought I was going to say whisk didn&#39;t you...."
- "I dished my little ones first then added Thyme for my bowl. I hope you enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Cream of Chicken &amp; Mushroom Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is done, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Make smart decisions when grocery shopping. When you make good decisions at the grocery store, your meals will get much healthier automatically. Think for a minute: you don't want to go to a chaotic grocery store or sit in a long line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to get home immediately and have something beneficial. Fill your cupboards with wholesome foods. This makes it easy to have a great meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is naturally better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are plenty of things you can do to become healthy. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about slimming down. You need to make your body as strong you can make it.
