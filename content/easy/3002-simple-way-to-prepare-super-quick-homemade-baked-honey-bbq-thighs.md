<i>Before you jump to Baked Honey Bbq Thighs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as effectively as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
