<i>Before you jump to Chicken 65 from Manisha&#39;s Kitchen recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as efficiently as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
