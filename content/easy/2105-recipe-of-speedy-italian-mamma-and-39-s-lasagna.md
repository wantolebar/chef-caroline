- "Then, let the sauce sit overnight."
- "Don&#39;t let the ragù sauce get watery. (If you do, the lasagna will become sticky.)"
- "On the second day, boil some water to parboil the lasagna. Put the salt in the water at about the same time you boil the pasta."
- "Like in the picture, when the water begins to boil, use the oven pan to parboil the pasta."
- "Don&#39;t put the pasta in the pot, put it in the oven pan and pour the boiling water on top."

- "Then, add a layer of ragù sauce."
- "Use a knife to spread it out."
- "Now, use your hands to tear the sliced cheese into pieces and add them in a layer on top of the sauce. One level of cheese should use about 1/2~2 slices of cheese. Please adjust according to your taste."
- "Next, sprinkle on some powdered cheese. This completes the first level. Next, make another level of lasagna using the same pattern."
- "It will rise when baking, so leave some empty space in the top part of the pan as in the picture."
- "Put Béchamel sauce, ragù sauce, sliced cheese, and powdered cheese on the very top layer to finish."
- "Bake in an oven at 200°F Celsius for 15-20 minutes to finish."

<i>Before you jump to Italian Mamma&#39;s Lasagna recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the conclusion of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Pick water over other drinks. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every now and then isn’t a terrible idea. Using them for your lone source of hydration, however, is dumb. Choosing water as an alternative to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories away from your diet— without having to resort to terrible tasting diet food. Successful weight loss efforts often depend solely on water ingestion.

There are a good deal of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done each day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
