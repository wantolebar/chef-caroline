<i>Before you jump to Pineapple-Apple Country Style Ribs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Maybe the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and maybe this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is not true. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
