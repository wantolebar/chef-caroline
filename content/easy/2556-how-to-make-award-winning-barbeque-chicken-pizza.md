<i>Before you jump to Barbeque chicken pizza recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. A lot of it truly is simply using common sense.
