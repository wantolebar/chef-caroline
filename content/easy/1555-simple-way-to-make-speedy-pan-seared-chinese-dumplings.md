Fry for 1 min until bottom golden brown then add hot boiling water into the pan so the dumplings in shallow water, lid covered and cook for 8 mins. If theres still water in the pan open lid cook until water evaporates crispy bottom. Serve hot with chinese black or red vinegar. Another lazy way is boil until cooked served in chicken broth. Done!"

<i>Before you jump to Pan Seared Chinese Dumplings 鍋貼 recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is done, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Drink water, not alternative drinks. Soda and coffee, when ingested in moderation, aren't that bad. It will be, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. Choosing water as an alternative to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Water is often one of the keys to successful weight reduction and healthfulness.

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. It is more about making your body as strong as it can be.
