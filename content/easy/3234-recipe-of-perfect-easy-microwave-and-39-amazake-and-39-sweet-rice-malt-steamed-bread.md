<i>Before you jump to Easy Microwave &#39;Amazake&#39; Sweet Rice Malt Steamed Bread recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
