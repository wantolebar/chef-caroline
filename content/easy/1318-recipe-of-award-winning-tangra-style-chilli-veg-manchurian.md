<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as efficiently as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely making use of common sense.
