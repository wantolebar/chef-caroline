recipeingredient:
- "1 salt pepper onion powder and garlic powder"
- "1 BBQ sauce your favorite flavor we like honey BBQ"
- "2 lb short boned ribs extra meaty if possible"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°F and line a large cookie sheet type pan with foil to catch grease. I also put a cooking rack on top of the foil so my rubs don&#39;t cook in their own grease."
- "During preheating, lay ribs meaty side down and douse liberally with seasonings. Flip and do meaty side."
- "Bake uncovered, meaty side up for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until proper temp has been reached. A meat thermometer is useful. They will look well cooked, and only slightly pulling away from the ends of the bones (1/4 inch or a bit more). Any longer and they may get tough."
- "Remove from oven and turn oven up quite high-mine goes to 500, so I like to use 450. Remove ribs to a plate or such for now, and drain off grease from pan. Replace ribs, meaty side down and slather underside with sauce, making sure to coat all exposed meat. Flip and do the meaty side liberally."
- "Return to oven and cook to finish off sauce, about 10-15 minutes, depending on sauce, oven and size."
- "When done, allow to cool and either slice individually or into portion sizes, 3-5 bones each, depending on meatiness."
- "Serves very well with pasta salad, cucumbers, watermelon and lemonade on a picnic."

<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Start with exchanging the light bulbs. This will probably go beyond the kitchen, nevertheless that is okay. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that difficult. A lot of it really is basically making use of common sense.
