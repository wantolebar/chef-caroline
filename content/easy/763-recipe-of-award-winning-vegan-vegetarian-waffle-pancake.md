<i>Before you jump to Vegan/ Vegetarian waffle Pancake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you will need to use them rather than incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house as well. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is basically making use of common sense.
