recipeinstructions:

- "Remove husk from corn and clean very well. Remove any bad spots. Over a large bowl use a knife to remove kernels from the cob. Then, take a spoon and &#39;milk&#39; the cob, removing all of the kernel bits and juice from the cob. I save one cob and milk it at the very end as a garnish."

- "Use an immersion blender or hand potato masher and blend 1/3 of potatoes to thicken broth. If you like a thicker chowder you can mix 2 tsp of cornstarch with some cold water and add to pot. Allow to simmer 10 more minutes and serve."
- "I garnish mine with fresh pulp from one corn, parmesan cheese and the bacon bits."
