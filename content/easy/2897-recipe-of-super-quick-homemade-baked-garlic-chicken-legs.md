<i>Before you jump to Baked Garlic Chicken Legs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Start out with exchanging the bulbs. Do this for your house, not merely the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent type, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. It's related to being functional, more often than not.
