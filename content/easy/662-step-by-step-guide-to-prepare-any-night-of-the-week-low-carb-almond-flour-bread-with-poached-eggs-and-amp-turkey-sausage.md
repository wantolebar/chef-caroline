- "2 eggs"
- "1/4 cup ground turkey sausage"
- "1/4 white onion diced small"
- "1/8 cup finely shredded cheese of your choice"
- " Salt and pepper"
- " 90 second Almond flour bread"

- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "Pinch salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make almond flour bread by mixing the flour, oil, salt, baking powder and egg in a small microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 90 seconds and then invert onto cutting board. Slice in half. If you want the texture to be a little stiffer and less like egg bread, pop in the toaster. Sprinkle with cheese while still hot. Set aside."
- "In a small frying pan, heat a little oil or butter and saute the onions until soft. Add ground turkey and brown. Optional: add a little heat to the meat with cayenne pepper or a spiced salt. Pour sausage and onions over bread."
- "Bring about 4 cups of salted water to a low boil in a small pot. When the water is just beginning to boil, crack open and drop two eggs in on opposite sides of the pan. Boil for 3-5 mins, until the white of the egg sets. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs, carefully shaking off the water and place on top of sausage and bread. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and slice open the egg so all that delicious yolk pours out and soaks into the bread."
- "Add salt and pepper as you like and enjoy!"

<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, after all. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
