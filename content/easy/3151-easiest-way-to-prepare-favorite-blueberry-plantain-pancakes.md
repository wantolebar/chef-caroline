<i>Before you jump to Blueberry Plantain Pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as efficiently as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
