<i>Before you jump to Bulgogi (Korean beef BBQ) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Let's begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. You should change your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that hard. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
