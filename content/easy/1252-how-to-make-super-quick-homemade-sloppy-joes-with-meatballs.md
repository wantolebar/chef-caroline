<i>Before you jump to Sloppy Joes with Meatballs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. This will go beyond the kitchen, nevertheless that is okay. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than merely replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house as well. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that hard. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
