<i>Before you jump to Bananas foster cupcakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A massive amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that tough. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
