<i>Before you jump to Crab Cakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Start with replacing the bulbs. This will go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights specifically will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This likewise happens in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. Mostly, all it will take is a little common sense.
