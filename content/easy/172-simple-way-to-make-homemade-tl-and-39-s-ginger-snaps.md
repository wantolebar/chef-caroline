That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as economically as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F.
