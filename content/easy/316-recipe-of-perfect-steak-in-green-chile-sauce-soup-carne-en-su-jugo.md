- " Cilantro"
- " Steak cut into bite sizes"
- " Thick cut bacon"
- " Knorr beef seasoning see picture bellow"
- " Beef broth"

- " Beans cooked"
recipeinstructions:
- "Begin by slicing bacon into bite size pieces. Cook on medium heat for approximately 3 minutes. Add steak pieces and beef seasoning. Mix with bacon and cook on medium heat. NOTE: any type of steak can be used. I personally buy the steak that is already cut into bite size pieces. I use all the bacon but if you choose, you may use less."
- "Meanwhile, cut all vegetables into smaller pieces and boil them in the water and beef broth for approximately 5-10 minutes."
- "When vegetables have been boiled, remove from stove and blend in batches. Strain blended vegetables into meat mixture. Reduce heat and simmer until meat is tender (about 30 mnts). NOTE: if the meat mixture has too much oil from the bacon, feel free to drain the fat."
- "The consistency should be soup like and the color should be greenish."
- "Separately, warm up the can of beans and rice. Leftover rice and beans work great. If you don&#39;t have any on hand then canned beans and microwaveable rice is a good option."
- "Serve soup with beans and rice. Garnish with onion and cilantro. Tortillas go very well with this dish. Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Steak In Green Chile Sauce Soup (Carne En Su Jugo) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Why don't we begin with something not that hard, changing the particular light bulbs. Complete this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you will need to use them rather than incandescent lights. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house at the same time. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is simply utilizing common sense.
