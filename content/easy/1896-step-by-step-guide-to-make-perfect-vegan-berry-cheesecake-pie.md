<i>Before you jump to Vegan berry cheesecake pie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Especially if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
