It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, after all. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
