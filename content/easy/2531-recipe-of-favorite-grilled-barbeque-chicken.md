It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
