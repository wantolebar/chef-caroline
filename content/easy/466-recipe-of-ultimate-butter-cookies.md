Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as efficiently as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.
