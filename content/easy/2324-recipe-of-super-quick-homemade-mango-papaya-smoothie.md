<i>Before you jump to Mango Papaya Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
