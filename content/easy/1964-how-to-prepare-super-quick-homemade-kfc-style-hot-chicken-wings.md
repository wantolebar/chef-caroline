<i>Before you jump to KFC Style Hot Chicken Wings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a spot to begin with as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. You need to replace your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more originally, these bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. It goes further than merely exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This also occurs in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. A lot of it is basically utilizing common sense.
