Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. It's about being functional, more often than not.
