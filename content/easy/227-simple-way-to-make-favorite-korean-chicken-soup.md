It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that difficult. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
