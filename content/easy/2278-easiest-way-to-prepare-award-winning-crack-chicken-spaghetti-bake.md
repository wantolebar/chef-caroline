<i>Before you jump to Crack Chicken Spaghetti Bake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that hard. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
