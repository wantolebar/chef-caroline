<i>Before you jump to Crispy Baked Chicken Thighs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. As soon as you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
