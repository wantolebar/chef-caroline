Changing light bulbs is as good a place get started on as any. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent type, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Utilizing these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to get the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not that hard. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
