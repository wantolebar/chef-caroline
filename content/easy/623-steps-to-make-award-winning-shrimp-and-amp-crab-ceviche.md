<i>Before you jump to Shrimp &amp; Crab Ceviche recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is going. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
