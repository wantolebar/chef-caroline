recipeinstructions:
- "Add sugar to a heavy based pot and heat until it starts to melt, and turn brown. Next add brown sugar and boiling water to another heavy based pot and bring to the boil without stirring. Add the melted white sugar to the melted brown sugar and simmer, stirring often until thickens. Remove from heat and add in the butter and vanilla. Note: It will start to thicken quickly so serve immediately over pancakes or waffles (reheat if it thickens too much). Makes about 2 cups."
- "Mix both ingredients together well and store in an airtight container at room temperature until needed. (Makes 1 cup)"
- "Mix the warm water in with the sugar well, let it dissolve. Clear Honey is also a good substitute for light corn syrup."
- "Place the granulated sugar and water in a bowl, and stir until well combined. Then use it as honey replacement."
- "Use a knife to split the vanilla beans open lengthwise, stop one inch from the end of each bean. Place the cut beans in a glass container (i.e. jar), and cover with vodka. Make sure the beans are completely submerged in the vodka. Secure the lid and store in a cool, dark place. Allow the flavours to mix for at least two months before using, shaking at least once a week."

- "There&#39;s two options with this substitute. You can either blend and use as it is or thicken the substitute by simmering it down on a medium heat. (Makes about a cup). Store in an airtight container in fridge and use with 4 days or a neat little trick is filling ice cube bags with the mixture and freezing, each cube is roughly 2 tablespoons."
- "Mix the ingredients well together. And replace the amount you need in your recipe."

<i>Before you jump to Substitute Recipes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These kinds of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Start out with changing the light bulbs. Do this for your house, not only the kitchen. You should replace your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more originally, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and discover just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is merely making use of common sense.
