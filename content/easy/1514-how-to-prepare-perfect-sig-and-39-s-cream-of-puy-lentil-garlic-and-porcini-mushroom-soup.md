<i>Before you jump to Sig&#39;s Cream of Puy Lentil,Garlic and Porcini Mushroom soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is done, most people do not wish to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your lifestyle choices. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
