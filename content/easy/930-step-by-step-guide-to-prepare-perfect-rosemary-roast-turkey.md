Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the actual light bulbs. Accomplish this for your house, not only the kitchen. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more initially, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills.

Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.
