recipeingredient:
- "1 packet instant brothless ramen but with a flavor packet"
- "1 egg boiled how you like it I like a softer boil"
- "1/4 head iceberg lettuce cut in 18strips"
- "1 medium carrot julienned"
- "2 green onions finely chopped"
- "1/2 leftover roasted chicken breast cut into 34 cubes I mean one entire side of the breast not half of a half"
- " toasted sesame oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start boiling your egg and the water for your ramen, then get to your knifework. The last pic on this step is the brand I used today. &#34;THAT&#39;S CRAZY HOT!&#34; is not kidding. If you&#39;re not a super chili head, I recommend using another type. ;) As I mentioned before, instant tsukemen is a great mild option."
- "When the noodles are cooked through, drain most of the water and add seasoning packet per package instructions. Around this time, your egg should probably be boiled as well so don&#39;t forget to take that off the stove, peel, and cut in half."
- "Finish up your knifework."
- "Split the noodles between two large-ish bowls and layer the veg and chicken evenly between them."
- "I saved the nori and sesame seed packet for garnish to sprinkle on top. So do that, drizzle about 2 teaspoons of toasted sesame oil, and add the egg."
- "Mix it all up and enjoy! And if you need just a little more seasoning, try adding a light dash of soy sauce and a squeeze of fresh lemon or lime. :)"

<i>Before you jump to Easy Instant No-Broth Ramen Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? Most people will decide to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your lifestyle choices. You need to make your body as strong it can be.
