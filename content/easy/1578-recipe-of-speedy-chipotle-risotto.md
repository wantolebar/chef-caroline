- "[Risotto]"
- "Heat the stock to a simmer in a medium saucepan, then lower the heat so that the stock just stays hot, add Cayenne and 4 tbls of the chipotle sauce (can add more or less based on spice level you want) to stock."
- "In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil and 1 Tbsp of the butter over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the chopped shallot or onion. Sauté for 1-2 minutes or until it is slightly translucent."

- "Add a ladle of hot chicken chipotle stock to the rice and stir until the liquid is fully absorbed. When the rice appears almost dry, add another ladle of stock and repeat the process."
- "Note: It&#39;s important to stir constantly, especially while the hot stock gets absorbed, to prevent scorching, and add the next ladle as soon as the rice is almost dry."
- "Continue adding ladles of hot stock and stirring the rice while the liquid is absorbed. As it cooks, you&#39;ll see that the rice will take on a creamy consistency as it begins to release its natural starches."
- "Continue adding stock, a ladle at a time, for 20-30 minutes or until the grains are tender but still firm to the bite, without being crunchy. If you run out of stock and the risotto still isn&#39;t done, you can quickly warm up some stock. Just add the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring while it&#39;s absorbed."
- "Stir in the parmesan cheese and when cheese is melted in add the remaining butter then add the parsley, and season to taste with Kosher salt. If the risotto is a little stiff add another ladle of stock and cook for a few seconds to get the perfect texture."
- "Risotto turns glutinous if held for too long, you should serve it right away. A properly cooked risotto should form a soft, creamy mound on a dinner plate. It shouldn&#39;t run across the plate, nor should it be stiff or gluey."
- "You can garnish with a little of the chipotle sauce (it is spicy so it is not necessary unless you want the kick) and avocado crema. The avocado crema will help bring some balance to the dish with its cooling effect."

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as effectively as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to run less frequently, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, of course. A lot of it truly is basically utilizing common sense.
