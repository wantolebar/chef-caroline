<i>Before you jump to Greek Salmon Panini recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good an area to start as any. Accomplish this for your house, not just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them in place of incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Utilizing these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to obtain the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. This also happens in the rest of the house, but we are trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Mostly, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
