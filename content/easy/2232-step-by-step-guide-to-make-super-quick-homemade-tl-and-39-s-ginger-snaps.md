It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. A lot of it truly is simply utilizing common sense.
