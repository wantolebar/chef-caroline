recipeingredient:
- "2 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour"
- "3/4 cup icecold water"
- "2 sticks Earth Balance dairyfree butter cubed and chilled"
- "1 tablespoon ground flaxseed"
- "1 tablespoon nutritional yeast optional"
- "1 teaspoon sugar"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- " room temperature water for brushing or eggwash if preferred"
- "1-2 deep dish 9 pie pans buttered and floured"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sift and thoroughly combine the dry ingredients together in a large mixing bowl. This can be done by hand with a whisk or large spoon, or in a mixer on low, if preferred."
- "Add the cold butter cubes to the flour mixture. Break down and combine using a pastry cutter or fork until the butter is pea-sized and blending with flour."
- "Add in cold water a couple of tbsp at a time (I normally end up using 6-12 tbsp depending on how many batches I am making). If you have an electronic mixer you can use the dough hook attachment for this next part. If not, your clean and floured hands will do. Work the dough, firmly pushing and folding until butter is melded completely and the dough holds together in the bowl. If it is wet and sticky, add more flour as needed. If it is too dry and crumbly, add more water as needed. Don&#39;t overmix!"
- "Once the kneaded dough is able to form a cohesive and stable ball inside the bowl, cut evenly in half, and transfer bowl to the freezer to let dough rest and firm as you work on your desired filling."
- "When ready to assemble your pie, remove dough from freezer. Lightly flour a clean flat surface on your counter. Using a floured rolling pin, take 1/2 of the dough and gently yet firmly roll out and stretch the dough until it is evenly flat and can cover the size of the desired dish."
- "Carefully lay your rolled-out dough inside the crust pan, letting the excess drape over the sides. Use the tips of your fingers to firmly press the sides and bottom into the pan. Take a fork and lightly poke holes in the crust for ventilation. Pinch and twist the edges for desired crust design."
- "Pour or spoon chosen filling over the bottom crust and smooth evenly. Roll out the second half of the pie dough as you did the first. Design top crust as desired (picture shows a lattice over a fruit filling), and gently puncture or slice small lines into the top with a fork or butter knife to ventilate, if needed for full top crusts."
- "Trim excess dough hanging over sides, and pinch edges into place. Brush with room temperature water or egg wash (whisked egg + dash of milk of choice), if preferred."
- "If using a particular filling recipe, cover the edges of the crust with foil to protect it from burning, and bake as instructed!"

<i>Before you jump to Plant-Based Pie Crust recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some hints to be as healthful as possible.

Drink water, not other beverages. Soda and coffee, when used in small amounts, aren't that bad. It will be, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. Having water instead of other types of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories away from your diet— without having to be forced to eat terrible tasting diet food. Water is often the key to successful weight reduction and healthfulness.

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. You need your body to be strong too.
