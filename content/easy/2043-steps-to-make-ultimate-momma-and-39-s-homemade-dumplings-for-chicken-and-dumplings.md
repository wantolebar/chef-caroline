<i>Before you jump to Momma&#39;s Homemade Dumplings for CHICKEN and DUMPLINGS recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the particular light bulbs. Complete this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Using these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than simply exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house as well. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and discover exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
