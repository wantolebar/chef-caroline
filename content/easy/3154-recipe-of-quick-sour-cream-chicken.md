<i>Before you jump to Sour Cream Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Let us begin with something really easy, changing the actual light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen area. You really need to replace your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more initially, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than simply replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house at the same time. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. A lot of it really is merely making use of common sense.
