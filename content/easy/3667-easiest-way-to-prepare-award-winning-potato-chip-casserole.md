<i>Before you jump to Potato Chip Casserole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Cash</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as efficiently as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
