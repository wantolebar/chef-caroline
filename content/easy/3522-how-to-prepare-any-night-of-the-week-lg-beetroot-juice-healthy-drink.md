<i>Before you jump to LG BEETROOT JUICE ( HEALTHY DRINK ) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less frequently, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that hard. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
