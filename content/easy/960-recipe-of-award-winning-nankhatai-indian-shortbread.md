<i>Before you jump to Nankhatai- Indian shortbread recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is done, most people do not want to go to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an attempt on the stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are a lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done each day, can do plenty to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. You need to make your body as strong it can be.
