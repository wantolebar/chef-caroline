The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

A massive amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can easily minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.
