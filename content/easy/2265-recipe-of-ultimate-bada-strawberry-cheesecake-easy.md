These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good an area to begin with as any. Accomplish this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. You should upgrade your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently discover members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed.
