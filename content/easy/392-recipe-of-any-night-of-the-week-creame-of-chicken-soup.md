Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
