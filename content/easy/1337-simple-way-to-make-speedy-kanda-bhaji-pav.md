<i>Before you jump to Kanda bhaji Pav recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not that difficult. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
