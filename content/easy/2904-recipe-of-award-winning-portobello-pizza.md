<i>Before you jump to Portobello Pizza recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

When you go grocery shopping, be smart about it. When you make informed and wise purchases at the grocery store, your meals will get healthier immediately. At the end of your day do you really want to deal with jampacked grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You’re going to go home and make what you already have. Make sure that what you have at home is nutritious. This makes it easy to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about losing weight. It’s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
