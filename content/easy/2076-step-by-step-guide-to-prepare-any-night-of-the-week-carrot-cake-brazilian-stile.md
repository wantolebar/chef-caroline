<i>Before you jump to Carrot cake (Brazilian stile) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a chore. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

Run the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Most people will choose to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. It’s about making your body as strong as it can be.
