<i>Before you jump to Matzo Ball Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as efficiently as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that hard. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
