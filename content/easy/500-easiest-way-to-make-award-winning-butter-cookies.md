<i>Before you jump to Butter Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty straightforward to live green, of course. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
