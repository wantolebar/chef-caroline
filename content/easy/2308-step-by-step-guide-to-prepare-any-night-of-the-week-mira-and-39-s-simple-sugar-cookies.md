<i>Before you jump to Mira&#39;s Simple Sugar Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, nonetheless that is not true. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is going. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that difficult. Mostly, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
