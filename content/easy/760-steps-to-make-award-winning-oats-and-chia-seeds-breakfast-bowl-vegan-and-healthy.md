<i>Before you jump to Oats and Chia seeds breakfast bowl - Vegan and Healthy recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle involves. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy.

Run the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are many things you can go after to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Don't ignore that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It has more to do with making your body as strong as it can be.
