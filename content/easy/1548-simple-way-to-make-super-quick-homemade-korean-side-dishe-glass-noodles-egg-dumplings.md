<i>Before you jump to Korean Side Dishe| Glass Noodles Egg Dumplings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that tough. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
