Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. By cool drying or air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
