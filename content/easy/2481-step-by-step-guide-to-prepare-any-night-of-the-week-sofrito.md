<i>Before you jump to Sofrito recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. It's concerning being practical, usually.
