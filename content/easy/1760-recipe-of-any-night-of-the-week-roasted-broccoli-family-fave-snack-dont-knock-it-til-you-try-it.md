recipeingredient:
- "2 large heads broccoli rinsed and thoroughly dried Shake off excess water"
- "1 Tablespoon olive oil"
- " optional 1 teaspoon onion powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 435 F / 225 C then cut up your broccoli, stems and all. I usually trim the bottom 1/8&#34; from the stem, cut it into florets, dividing the florets into 2 or 3 even pieces, depending on their size.   Then cut the stems into 1/4&#34; thick coins.  Put it all in a large mixing bowl."
- "Toss thoroughly with olive oil and (optional) onion powder."
- "Spread over two baking sheets/sheet pans. You don&#39;t want to crowd the broccoli because then you won&#39;t get a good roast with the crispy bits.  Put in the oven and roast for 20 minutes.  If you want to serve with aioli (link above), you can make that now while the broccoli&#39;s roasting."
- "After 20 minutes, take out of the oven, let cool for about 5 minutes, transfer to a serving dish, and watch them disappear!"

<i>Before you jump to Roasted Broccoli (Family Fave Snack - Don’t knock it ‘til you try it!) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are a lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. Little things, when done every single day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need to make your body as strong as possible.
