<i>Before you jump to Caramelised fennel - vegan recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Let us begin with something quite simple, changing the particular light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights especially tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and discover how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. It's about being practical, usually.
