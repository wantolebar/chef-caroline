It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. A lot of it really is basically making use of common sense.
