recipeingredient:
- "3 and 2/3 cups  (420g) cake flour spoon  leveled"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "3 large eggs  2 additional egg whites at room temperature"
- "2 cups (400 g) granulated sugar"
- "1 and 1/2 cups (345g) unsalted butter"
- "1 teaspoon baking powder"
- "1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) buttermilk"
- "3/4 teaspoon baking soda"
- "1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extract"
- " Vanilla Buttercream"
- "1 and 1/2 cups (345g) unsalted butter"
- "1/8 teaspoon salt"
- "6 cups (720 g) confectioners sugar"
- "1/8 teaspoon salt"
- "1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease three 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans."
- "Make the cake: Whisk the cake flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together. Set aside."
- "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Beat in the 3 eggs, 2 egg whites, and vanilla extract on high speed until combined, about 2minutes. (Mixture will look curdled as a result of the egg liquid and solid butter combining.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed."
- "Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Weigh them to ensure accuracy, if desired. Bake for around 23-26 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To taste for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it’s done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling."
- "Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, milk, vanilla extract, and salt with the mixer running on low. Increase to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Add more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin, more milk if frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet."
- "Assemble and decorate: Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with about 1 and 1/2 cups of frosting. Top with 2nd cake layer and evenly cover the top with about 1 and 1/2 cups of frosting. Top with the third cake layer. Spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I use and recommend an icing"
- "Refrigerate cake for at least 1 hour before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting."

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. When our work day is done, most people do not wish to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some very simple ways to get healthful.

Water is the very best drinks out there. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every now and then isn’t a bad idea. Getting all your hydration from them is a terrible idea.

This also helps you lower your caloric intake by hundreds of points without having to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Water is often the key to successful weight-loss and healthfulness.

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every single day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
