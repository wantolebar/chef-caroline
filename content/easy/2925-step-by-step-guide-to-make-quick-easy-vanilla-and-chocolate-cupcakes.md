Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. It's about being practical, more often than not.
