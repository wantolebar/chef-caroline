<i>Before you jump to Chocolate cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. It's about being sensible, usually.
