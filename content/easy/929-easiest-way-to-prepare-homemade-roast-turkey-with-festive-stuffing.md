- " Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Take the turkey out of the fridge half an hour before you are going to start roasting. Put it on the washed kitchen surface and clean with damp kitchen roll. Preheat the oven to 240ยบ. Stuff the turkey"
- "Rub the butter all over the turkey with your hands. Do the same with the salt and pepper. Tie the legs together with string or foil. This will prevent the stuffing from spilling out during roasting time. Put the turkey on the oven tray and give your hands a good wash in warm soapy water. Cover the roasting tray with foil and put the whole thing in the oven. After 20 minutes put the oven down to 165ยบ"
- "After one and a half hours, take the turkey out and take the foil off. It will look like this. Put it back in the oven for another hour and a half."
- "During this time every half hour pour the turkey juices over the turkey to keep it moist"
- "When you think the turkey is done, pierce the part joining the leg to the body with a skewer. If the juices come out clean, the turkey is cooked. If they are murky, it needs more time."
- "Put the excess juices into the stock you have made for the gravy. Turn the oven off and put some serving plates in - they will warm up nicely while the turkey is resting."
- "Put the turkey onto the carving board or plate and let it rest for half an hour before carving. While the turkey is resting, pour the gravy into the oven tray to get all the little tasty bits that have stuck to the tin"
- "Use a very sharp knife to carve the turkey and arrange on the warmed plates with the stuffing. Uncork the wine, pull the crackers and enjoy :-)"

<i>Before you jump to Roast turkey with festive stuffing recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Working out at the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Take the stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
