<i>Before you jump to Lightly Salted Stir-Fried Chicken and Cashew Nuts recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. It's about being functional, more often than not.
