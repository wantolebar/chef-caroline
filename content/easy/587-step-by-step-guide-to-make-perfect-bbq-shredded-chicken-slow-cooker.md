<i>Before you jump to BBQ Shredded Chicken - Slow Cooker recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
