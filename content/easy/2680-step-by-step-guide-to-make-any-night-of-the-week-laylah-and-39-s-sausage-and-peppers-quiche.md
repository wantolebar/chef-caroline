<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as economically as they should. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
