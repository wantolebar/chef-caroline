<i>Before you jump to AMIEs BAKED FENNEL recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as economically as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that tough. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
