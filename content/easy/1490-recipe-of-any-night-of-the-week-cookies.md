<i>Before you jump to Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Most people will decide to be idle and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are many things you can go after to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being smart about the selections you make each day is a start. Trying to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need your body to be powerful too.
