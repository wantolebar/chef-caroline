Although costing a little more in the beginning, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Using these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to obtain the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and discover how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. It's about being sensible, usually.
