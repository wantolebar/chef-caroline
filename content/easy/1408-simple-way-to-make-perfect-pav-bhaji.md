<i>Before you jump to Pav Bhaji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. It's about being functional, most of the time.
