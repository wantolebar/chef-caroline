<i>Before you jump to Bacon Chicken Carbonara recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that tough. Largely, all it requires is a little common sense.
