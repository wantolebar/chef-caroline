<i>Before you jump to Oven Baked Chicken Nepali Style recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
