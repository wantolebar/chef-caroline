<i>Before you jump to Lukaane Ka Shorba/Bone Broth recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it really is merely making use of common sense.
