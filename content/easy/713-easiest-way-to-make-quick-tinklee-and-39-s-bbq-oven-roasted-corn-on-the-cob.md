<i>Before you jump to Tinklee&#39;s BBQ/Oven Roasted Corn on the Cob recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. A lot of it truly is merely making use of common sense.
