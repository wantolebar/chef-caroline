<i>Before you jump to 1 min perfect chocolate mug cake in microwave recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that tough. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
