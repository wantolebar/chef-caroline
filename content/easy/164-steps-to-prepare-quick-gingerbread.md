<i>Before you jump to Gingerbread recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good an area to begin with as any. Complete this for the whole house, not just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Using these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than simply replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly discover members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. Typically, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
