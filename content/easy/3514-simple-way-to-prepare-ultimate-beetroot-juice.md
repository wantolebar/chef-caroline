It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.
