It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around.

This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as efficiently as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
