recipeingredient:
- " Barley miso"
- " Koji miso"
- " Light brown sugar or white sugar"
- " Mirin"
- " Sake"
- " Soy sauce"
- " Mizuame Japanese"
- " Coarse powdered chili Korean"
- " Fine powdered chili powder Korean"
- " Paprika powder Korean"
recipeinstructions:
- "[For the miso:] The ideal ratio should be 3 parts barley miso to 1 part koji miso. You can use your usual miso. Make sure that the miso does not have added dashi!"
- "[For the sugar:] You can use your usual sugar. I don&#39;t recommend any specific type. A small amount of muscovado or cane sugar will give a rich flavour."
- "[For the mizuame:] If you use Korean mizuame, it is very runny, so omit the mirin in the ingredients and substitute that amount with sugar."
- "[For the powdered chili:] Make sure that the powdered chili is Korean. If you use Japanese chili powder, it will be too hot and not suitable for gochujang."
- "[For the Korean powdered chili:] Grinding chili in different ways produces varying degrees of spiciness and flavours. Coarsely powdered chili is ground with seeds, so it is very hot."
- "By grinding only the flesh of the chili, fine chili powder is obtained. It has a beautiful orange colour and a mild flavour. Blend different kinds of chili powder..."
- "You will have a deep and complex flavour in the resultant gochujang. If you want to make this chili paste, this is a good occasion to buy different kinds of chili powder."
- "[For the paprika powder:] This is optional, but it gives a vivid red colour and good flavour to gochujang. I recommend it."
- "After you prepare all the ingredients, mix them together! Make sure that your bowl and spatula are very dry."
- "Mix until very smooth. If you find the mixture too stiff and difficult to combine, place the bowl on a bain-marie. If you place the mixture over direct heat, you will lose the miso flavour."
- "Just continue to mix. Adjust the consistency with sake or mirin. If it is too stiff, it may be difficult to handle when used. It shouldn&#39;t be too runny, either."
- "Once the mixture is smooth, transfer into a clean bottle or any container with a lid. Keep in the fridge. The gochujang should become more translucent and vivid in colour after several days."

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Gochujang for Bibimbap recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Make smart choices when grocery shopping. When you make good decisions at the grocery store, your meals will get healthier immediately. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to deal with a chaotic store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You’re going to go home and make what you have in the cupboards. Your kitchen should be filled with healthy foods and ingredients. In this way, even when you decide that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent about the choices you make each day is a start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It is more about making your body as strong as it can be.

##### Instructions to make Homemade Gochujang for Bibimbap:

1. [For the miso:] The ideal ratio should be 3 parts barley miso to 1 part koji miso. You can use your usual miso. Make sure that the miso does not have added dashi!
1. [For the sugar:] You can use your usual sugar. I don&#39;t recommend any specific type. A small amount of muscovado or cane sugar will give a rich flavour.
1. [For the mizuame:] If you use Korean mizuame, it is very runny, so omit the mirin in the ingredients and substitute that amount with sugar.
1. [For the powdered chili:] Make sure that the powdered chili is Korean. If you use Japanese chili powder, it will be too hot and not suitable for gochujang.
1. [For the Korean powdered chili:] Grinding chili in different ways produces varying degrees of spiciness and flavours. Coarsely powdered chili is ground with seeds, so it is very hot.
1. By grinding only the flesh of the chili, fine chili powder is obtained. It has a beautiful orange colour and a mild flavour. Blend different kinds of chili powder...
1. You will have a deep and complex flavour in the resultant gochujang. If you want to make this chili paste, this is a good occasion to buy different kinds of chili powder.
1. [For the paprika powder:] This is optional, but it gives a vivid red colour and good flavour to gochujang. I recommend it.
1. After you prepare all the ingredients, mix them together! Make sure that your bowl and spatula are very dry.
1. Mix until very smooth. If you find the mixture too stiff and difficult to combine, place the bowl on a bain-marie. If you place the mixture over direct heat, you will lose the miso flavour.
1. Just continue to mix. Adjust the consistency with sake or mirin. If it is too stiff, it may be difficult to handle when used. It shouldn&#39;t be too runny, either.
1. Once the mixture is smooth, transfer into a clean bottle or any container with a lid. Keep in the fridge. The gochujang should become more translucent and vivid in colour after several days.
