recipeingredient:
- "50 grams Cake Flour"
- "20 grams Cocoa powder"
- "3 grams Baking powder"
- "2 Eggs"
- "35 grams Sugar"
- "50 grams Butter"
- "60 ml Heavy cream"
- "150 grams Dark chocolate"
- "7 Strawberries"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare strawberries and 30 g of the chocolate. Cut into any sized pieces you like. I cut the strawberries into 2 x 2 cm since I like to taste the chunks of strawberries in the muffins."
- "Combine and sift the cake flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder. Preheat the oven to 340°F/170°C."
- "Mix the butter (at room temperature) until creamy. Add sugar and mix until light and fluffy."
- "Beat the egg enough to break the egg white. Before adding the egg to the butter, microwaving for 20 - 30 seconds will help prevent the mixture from separating."
- "Add the beaten egg in 4-5 batches and mix in. *If the egg cools, microwave for 5 seconds at a time to warm before adding."
- "It&#39;s done mixing. This recipe uses a lot of egg, so it will look very creamy. If it looks like it&#39;s going to separate, try adding 1- 2 tablespoons of the sifted flour and mix in."
- "Melt the chocolate with heavy cream and mix until shiny and smooth."
- "Add melted chocolate and heavy cream in 2 - 3 batches and mix until smooth."
- "Now add the dry ingredients in 3 batches, mixing each time. When adding the first batch, use a whisk to mix well until smooth."
- "When adding the second and third batches, use a rubber spatula to mix gently... try to mix like you are scooping up the batter from the bottom of the bowl, being careful not to over mix."
- "When there are no more lumps and the batter is fluffy, add strawberries and chocolate (reserve some for topping the muffins)."
- "Pour the batter into muffin cups until they are about 60% full. Top with chocolate and strawberries and bake in a 340°F/170°C oven for 30 minutes."
- "The just-baked muffins will be warm, fluffy and oozing with chocolate. Sweet-sour strawberry flavor and melted chocolate."
- "If you&#39;re going to eat the muffins later, after they cool down a bit, put in a plastic bag to cool completely. The steam will stay in the bag and keep them moist."

<i>Before you jump to Stawberry Chocolate Muffins recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it is basically making use of common sense.
