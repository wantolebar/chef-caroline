recipeingredient:
- "9 Tbsp unsalted butter"
- "2 3 C Xylotil or sugar substitute to taste"
- "11 tbsp cocoa powder"
- "3 eggs room temp"
- "3 4 C almond flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Position a rack in the lower third of your oven and preheat to 350째F/180째C. Line with parchment paper the bottom and sides of a 8x8-inch baking pan. Set aside."
- "Add butter, sweetener (stevia does not work!), cocoa powder and salt to a medium heatproof bowl."
- "Melt this mixture over a water bath whisking constantly (or use the microwave, in small increments). You&#39;ll want to heat it up until most of the sweetener has melted and the mixture is well incorporated (note that erythritol, unlike xylitol, won&#39;t dissolve much at this point). Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly."
- "Add one egg at a time, whisking well after each one until completely incorporated. The texture should appear smooth, with all the sweetener dissolving into the mixture. And if using erythritol, and your batter ends up too thick, you may want to add an extra egg. Just be sure not to over-whisk, or your brownies could end up more cakey rather than fudgy."
- "Add the almond flour, whisking vigorously until fully blended (about a minute)."
- "Bake for 10-20 minutes (we do about 23 with xylitol and 17 with erythritol), or until the center is just set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out moist. This really does vary (a lot!!) from oven to oven (think convection etc), so give them a check from minute 15 the first time around, and remember that your brownies will continue to cook while they cool."
- "Sprinkle with flakey sea salt (optional) and allow to cool completely on a rack. Lift brownies using the edges of the parchment paper and cut into desired size (we do 16!). To get extra clean edges, place in the freezer for 10 minutes prior to cutting."

<i>Before you jump to Super Fudgey Keto Brownies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. It's related to being sensible, usually.
