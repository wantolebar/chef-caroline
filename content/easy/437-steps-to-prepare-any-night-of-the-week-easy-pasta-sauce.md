recipeinstructions:
- "Remember to salt your pasta water so that it tastes as salty as the sea. Let it come to a boil and add in your pasta. I like Catelli Smart. It&#39;s healthy and quick to cook."
- "Put half can of half and half milk to your can of soup to make sauce creamy. I choose cream of broccoli by Campbell&#39;s"
- "Add veggie water from can into soup and stir in the veg you want. I chose Summer Sweet Peas."
- "Once soup is almost at a boil put corn starch into plastic container with lid, add cold water and shake till it&#39;s all mixed together. Add mixture to soup and stir till thick. I use corn starch instead of flower because it doesn&#39;t give the sauce that dull flavor no matter how much spice you use."
- "Makes large quantity of sauce so if your not serving a full house you can take clean jars and instantly pour left overs into jars. Put lids on and place in fridge. The steam from the sauce and the sharp cold of the fridge reseals the jars as if you had done it the proper way. Lasts for about a week in the fridge if your not like me and eat lots of pasta haha"
- "Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add sauce to cooked pasta and enjoy! This is also an awesome pasta &#39;salad&#39; when it gets cooled!"

<i>Before you jump to Easy Pasta Sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle involves. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Consider the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an attempt on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are lots of things you can pursue to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. You need to make your body as strong you can make it.
