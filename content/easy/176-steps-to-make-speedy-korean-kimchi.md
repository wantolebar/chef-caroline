<i>Before you jump to Korean Kimchi recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a place to begin with as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen area. You need to replace your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than simply exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This also occurs in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and discover exactly how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
