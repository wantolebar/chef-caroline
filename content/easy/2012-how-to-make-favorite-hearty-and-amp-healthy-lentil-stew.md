<i>Before you jump to Hearty &amp; Healthy Lentil Stew recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesnâ€™t have to be a pain. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

Water is the very best drinks out there. Having a soda or cup of coffee every so often won't hurt you too badly. It will be, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. Drinking water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to aid your body in its health and hydration. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Water is often the key to successful weight-loss and healthfulness.

There are a lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
