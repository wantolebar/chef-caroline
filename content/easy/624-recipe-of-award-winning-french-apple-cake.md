<i>Before you jump to French Apple Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that tough. It's about being functional, most of the time.
