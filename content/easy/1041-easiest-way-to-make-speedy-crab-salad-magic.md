It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and maybe this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is definitely not true. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
