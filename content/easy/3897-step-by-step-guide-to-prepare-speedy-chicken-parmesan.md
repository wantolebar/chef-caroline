<i>Before you jump to Chicken parmesan recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Cash</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as effectively as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
