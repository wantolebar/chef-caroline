<i>Before you jump to Malaysian Rice and Chicken Congee recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many individuals incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a little common sense.
