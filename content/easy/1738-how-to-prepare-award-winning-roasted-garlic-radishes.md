According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.
