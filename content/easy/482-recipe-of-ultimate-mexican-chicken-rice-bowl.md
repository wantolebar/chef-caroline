<i>Before you jump to Mexican Chicken Rice Bowl recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. A lot of it truly is simply making use of common sense.
