<i>Before you jump to Strawberry grahm cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Start with replacing the light bulbs. This will probably go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them in place of incandescent lights. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Obviously this also happens in different rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, after all. Largely, all it requires is a little common sense.
