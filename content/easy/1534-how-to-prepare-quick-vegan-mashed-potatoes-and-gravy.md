<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as economically as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. It's concerning being sensible, more often than not.
