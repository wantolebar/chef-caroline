<i>Before you jump to KFC Style Hot Chicken Wings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good an area to begin with as any. Do this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. You need to upgrade your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more originally, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house as well. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
