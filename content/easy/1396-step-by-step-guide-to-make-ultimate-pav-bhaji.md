<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
