With training you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Pick water over other refreshments. Sipping a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. Using them for your only source of hydration, however, is dumb.
