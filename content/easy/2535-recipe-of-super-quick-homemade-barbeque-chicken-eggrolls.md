<i>Before you jump to Barbeque Chicken Eggrolls recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a spot to start as any. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Together with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. It's related to being functional, usually.
