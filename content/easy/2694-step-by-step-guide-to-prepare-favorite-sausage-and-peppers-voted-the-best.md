- " Sausage and Peppers  the BEST EVER"
- " sausages"
- " balsamic vinegar"
- " medium onion sliced thin"
- " medium red pepper sliced"
- " medium green pepper sliced"
- " garlic  large cloves diced"
- " red pepper flakes to your liking"
- " can Italian flavored diced tomatoes strained keep liquid"
- " large mushrooms sliced"
- " tomato paste"
- " butter"
- " Olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Let&#39;s talk about packaged sausages. Sausages are packaged 3 different ways - a full long link, a package of 6 or in bulk. When slicing full links use a measurement of about 1&#34;wide. The prepackaged links of 6 cut in thirds - this gives you little over 1&#34;. The bulk packaged sausages tend to be longer than the smaller package - these should be cut in fours. When in doubt size them up before cutting."
- "Use a 4 quart pot. Slice sausages and stab two opposite sides with knife tip. This prevents oil build up under the skin and also allows even cooking. Then place in pot with just enough water to cover; add 2-3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and set on high temp to boil. The more balsamic vinegar you add the more flavor you will have. When the water starts to boil turn it down to med-high."
- "The water will start to evaporate leaving a glaze. Turn the heat down and start stirring the sausages but do not brown them. Start to remove the sausages and drain them of grease (I use paper towels in a strainer and just swish them around)."
- "Turn down the heat to just below medium. Add onion and stir in a tablespoon of butter (at this point also add in a bit of olive oil to prevent burning). Any time you add vegetables always check to make sure they are not burning and adjust the heat. Add peppers and garlic stir and cook for about 3-4 mintues (keep checking temp on veggies)."
- "Add sausages back to vegetables along with strained tomatoes and sliced mushrooms. Stir to blend then cover and turn heat down to med-low."
- "After 3 minutes stir in tomato paste. Cover and cook about 3-4 minutes more. Check liquid (it will create a nice flavored sauce) in pot and if needed add some of the reserved tomato liquid. We are looking to create a thin sauce not watery which is why the tomato paste amount is varied. Turn down to almost a low heat and cook for an additional 15-20 minutes."
- "Serve with bread or over penne. My family likes penne - if you decide to use pasta once it is cooked combine the left over liquid to drained pasta before adding the sausage and peppers this provides more moisture. Enjoy!!"

<i>Before you jump to Sausage and Peppers - voted the BEST recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Consider the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get wholesome. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Don't forget that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It’s about making your body as strong as it can be.
