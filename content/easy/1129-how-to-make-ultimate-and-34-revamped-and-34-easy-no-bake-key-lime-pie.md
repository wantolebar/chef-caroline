<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it truly is merely making use of common sense.
