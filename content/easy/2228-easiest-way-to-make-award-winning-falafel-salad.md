Using a slotted spoon, remove the falafel from the oil to a paper towel-lined plate and let cool and excess oil drip off. Repeat process with the remaining falafels."

- "To make the Tahini dressing combine all of the ingredients in a blender, and blend until smooth and creamy. Add more water to thin, if desired. It will thicken up when it&#39;s chilled!"

<i>Before you jump to Falafel Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's about being practical, more often than not.
