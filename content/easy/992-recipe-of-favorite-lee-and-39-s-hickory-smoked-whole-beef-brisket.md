- " Degrees Preheated Oven"
- " Whole Beef Packer Brisket"
- " Your Favorite Rub Seasoning"
- " Prepared Yellow Mustard"
- " Water Soaked Hickory Chips"
- " your Favorite Beer"
recipeinstructions:
- "Season Brisket liberally with your rub, and coat well with the yellow mustard. Place in the refrigerator overnight."
- "The next day... Let the brisket come to room temperature. Meanwhile prepare your smoker and bring to temperature. I like it to be around 250 degrees."
- "Place on smoker fat side up. Let the brisket smoke on low heat for about 3 hours. I&#39;m not trying to cook at this point, just a good long smoke."
- "When done smoking, place brisket in a large pan and add your favorite beer and cover. This will become your sauce at the end. Cover and cook in the oven at 225 degrees until done. The time until done will vary. An 8 pound brisket will take around another 6-7 hours in the oven. I cook mine until it jiggles like jello. Internal temperature of around 200 degrees."
- "I know this might seem overcooked, but it&#39;s not. Let it rest until it comes to room temperature. Refrigerate it overnight. Then you can cut it and get nice slices. Note: After slicing cover well with all the leftover juice&#39;s from the pan. Message me with any questions. Enjoy"

<i>Before you jump to Lee&#39;s Hickory Smoked Whole Beef Brisket recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Begin with changing the lights. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you should use them in place of incandescent lights. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This also takes place in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it truly is merely making use of common sense.
