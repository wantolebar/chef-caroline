recipeingredient:
- "2 rice bowls full Plaincooked rice"
- "2 sheets  Toasted nori seaweed"
- "1 dash  Sesame oil"
- "1 dash  Salt"
- "100 grams  Ground pork"
- "2 tbsp  Yakiniku Japanese BBQ sauce"
- "1  Egg"
- "1 dash  Salt"
- "2  Shiitake mushrooms"
- "1 dash  Soy sauce"
- "4 slice Kamaboko or imitation crab stick"
- "2 bunches Mizuna greens"
- "1 Toasted white sesame seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the △ ground pork in the yakiniku sauce. Add salt to the ■ egg, Heat some oil in a frying pan and make scrambled eggs. Blanch the mizuna greens in boiling salted water. Slice the ○ shiitake mushrooms, put into a bowl with a little soy sauce, cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 15 seconds. Leave as-is to cool."
- "Place a sheet of nori seawed on a sushi mat with the non-shiny (rough) side up. Drizzle on some sesame oil and spread it all around using a piece of paper towel. Sprinkle with salt. Spread about 1 bowlful of rice over the nori, and sprinkle on some white sesame seeds."
- "Add the prepared fillings from Step 2. Leave a gap in the front and back to make it easier to roll up the roll."
- "Pick up the front end of the sushi mat and push it over the filling towards the center in one motion and press. Then keep on rolling without hesitation. The roll looks like this. Some of the filling may be sticking out from the sides, so just push them back in gently and tidy up the roll."
- "If you cut the roll with the seam side down, the slices will be nicer looking. Wipe the knife each time you make a cut with a moistened kitchen towel - this way the slices are less likely to fall apart. Cut to whatever thickness you like and enjoy."

<i>Before you jump to Gimbap: Korean Nori Seaweed Rolls recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Drink water, not other drinks. Soda and coffee, when consumed in moderation, aren't that bad. Getting all your hydration from them is a awful idea. Ingesting water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to aid your body in its health and hydration. This also helps you reduce your caloric intake by hundreds of points without requiring you to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Water is often one of the keys to successful weight reduction and healthfulness.

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. It has more to do with making your body as strong as it can be.
