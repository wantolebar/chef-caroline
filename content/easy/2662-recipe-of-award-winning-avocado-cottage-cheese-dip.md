Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet.

Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Utilizing these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to acquire the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
