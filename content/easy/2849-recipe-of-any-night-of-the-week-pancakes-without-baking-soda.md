<i>Before you jump to Pancakes without baking soda recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
