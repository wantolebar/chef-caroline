- " grated zest of 1 lemon"
- "360 g (2 1/4 cups) plain flour"
- "dash salt"

- "1 cup poppy seeds"
- "1/2 cup raisins"
- " juice of  lemon"
- "1/2 tablespoon brandy"
- " For the marzipan filling"
- "100 g ground almonds"
- "100 g icing sugar plus extra to dust"
- "2 freerange egg yolks"
- "2 tbsp. lemon juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "To make the pastry, beat the icing sugar and the egg yolks in a food processor or with an electric mixer. Add the butter and lemon zest and beat to blend. Gradually add the flour and the salt, mixing until it forms a ball. Wrap it in cling film and refrigerate for an hour or overnight."
- "To make the marzipan, put the ground almonds, icing sugar and egg yolks in a bowl. Mix with a spatula, gradually adding the lemon juice, until the marzipan is smooth with a doughy consistency. Form a ball or a long sausage shape on a surface liberally dusted with icing sugar, wrap in cling film and refrigerate."
- "To make the poppy seed filling, grind the poppy seeds in a coffee grinder almost to a powder. Put the milk, sugar, vanilla seeds and the pod, and orange zest in a pan and bring to the boil. Fish out the vanilla pod and discard. Pour in the poppy seeds and raisins and turn the heat down so it just simmers. Stir every now and then and cook for about 15 minutes until almost all the liquid is absorbed and the poppy seeds thicken considerably. Add the lemon juice, the brandy and the butter, stir in and cook for another 3-4 minutes until the mix reaches thick, spreading consistency. Leave to cool."
- "Each of the above amounts of filling is enough to fill all the cookies so if you’re making a mix, you’ll have quite a bit of leftover filling, which can easily be frozen. Otherwise halve the ingredients."
- "When you’re ready to make the biscuits, bring the pastry to almost room temperature, otherwise it will be impossible to roll out."
- "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4. Line at least 2 baking sheets with parchment paper (this amount makes 35 biscuits so you’ll probably need to re-use the sheets)."
- "Roll out the dough to about 3mm thickness – if it’s too thick it will crack when folding the edges."
- "Cut out circles with a 3 inch pastry cutter. Put a heaping teaspoon of the poppy seed filling or a blob of marzipan the size of a walnut in the centre of each. Brush the edges with the beaten egg and fold the sides to form a triangle."
- "Brush the tops with beaten egg.  Bake until golden and firm all the way through, about 15-20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack."

<i>Before you jump to Hamantaschen recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is complete, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Consider the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will decide to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get wholesome. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every single day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about reducing your weight. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
