<i>Before you jump to Turkish Hummus - Chickpea Dip recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is not true. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
