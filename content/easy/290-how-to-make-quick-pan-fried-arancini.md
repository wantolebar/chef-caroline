recipeinstructions:
- "Form leftover risotto into patties, about 1/2&#34;thick and 3&#34; wide."
- "Prepare 3 plates. On one plate, combine flour, salt, and pepper. On another, spread out your panko. Crack your eggs on the 3rd and mix them up well. like if you were about to make scrambled eggs."
- "Coat your patties, one by one. First, dusting with the flour, then dunking in the egg to coat, and finally, pressing into the panko, making sure to coat all of the sides."
- "Heat a good amount of oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. About 1/4&#34; deep is good. The oil should be pretty hot. When you drop a piece of panko in, it should sizzle rapidly. Careful! Any time you&#39;ve got this much hot oil in a shallow pan, you need to watch yourself and your surroundings. Kids out of the kitchen! You deserve some &#39;me&#39; time anyway."
- "Gently slide your rice patties into the hot oil. A fish spatula will come in handy for this. Keep in mind that if you&#39;re not gentle, hot oil will fly everywhere."
- "You will start to see some golden brown crust around the edges pretty quick. No more than a few minutes, and these babies are ready to flip. Carefully again, flip the patties away from you, so that if you drop one, the oil will squirt away instead of toward you."
- "Another couple of minutes and you&#39;re done. Move the crispy patties to a paper towel to dry up some of that grease, and serve. great with just about any of your favorite dipping sauces."

<i>Before you jump to Pan Fried Arancini recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

You may possibly prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. A lot of it truly is merely using common sense.
