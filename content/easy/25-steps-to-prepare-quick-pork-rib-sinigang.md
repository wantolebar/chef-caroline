recipeingredient:
- "1 large onion thinly sliced"
- "1 full rack pork back ribs trimmed and cut into 2 rib segments"
- "6 cloves garlic roughly chopped"
- "6 cups vegetable stock"
- "4 large bay leaves"
- "1/2 cup tamarind concentrate"
- "3 tbsp fish sauce"
- "3 Roma tomatoes chopped"
- "1 jalapeno halved"
- "1 large eggplant chopped into 2 cm chunks"
- "1 large handful green beans trimmed"
- "8 pcs baby bok choy"
- "2 cups baby spinach"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add a splash of veg oil to a wide, high-sided pan on medium-high heat. Add the onions and fry for 2 to 3 minutes until softened. Season the ribs with salt and pepper and add them to the pan. Sear about 2 minutes, then flip and sear about 2 minutes more. At the flip, add the garlic. As the ribs brown, move the onions and garlic around a bit so they don&#39;t burn."
- "Add enough stock to the pan to cover the ribs. If more liquid is needed, just top up with water. Add the bay leaves, tamarind concentrate, and fish sauce. Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down to medium-low. After 15 minutes, skim any foam from the surface."
- "Add the tomatoes and jalapeno to the pan. Cover, and let simmer for 1 1/2 hrs until the meat is tender. Add water as needed to keep the ribs submerged."
- "Remove the bay leaves and jalapeno. Add the eggplant and turn the heat back up to medium-high. Continue simmering uncovered for 5 minutes. Add the beans and bok choy and simmer another 5 minutes. Check the seasoning and add salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste. Take the pan off the heat and add the spinach. Give the spinach a minute to wilt, then serve the soup hot with steamed rice."

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as efficiently as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
