<i>Before you jump to Poblano Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to run less frequently, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, after all. Largely, all it requires is a little common sense.
