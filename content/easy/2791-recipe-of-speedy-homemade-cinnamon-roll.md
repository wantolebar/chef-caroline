Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Perhaps the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Perhaps the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong.

Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
