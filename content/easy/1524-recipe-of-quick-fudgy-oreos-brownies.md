<i>Before you jump to Fudgy oreos brownies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Start with changing the bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you should use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than simply replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. This also takes place in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
