Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, after all. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
