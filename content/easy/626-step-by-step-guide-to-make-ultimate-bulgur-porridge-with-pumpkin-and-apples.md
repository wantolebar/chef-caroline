<i>Before you jump to Bulgur Porridge with Pumpkin and Apples recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that difficult. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
