<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is not true. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it will take is a little common sense.
