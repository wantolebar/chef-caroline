recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Pancake mix"
- "1 Egg whole egg"
- "40 grams Butter salted or unsalted"
- "3 tbsp Sugar"
- "5 tbsp Nuts sesame seeds chopped chocolate chips"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the butter in a bowl and microwave for 20 seconds until it melts."
- "Beat the egg and then combine it with the sugar and nuts, and then with the butter and mix with a whisk."
- "Add in the pancake mix, and then with a rubber spatula, cut in the batter. Once the dough starts to come together, put it in a plastic bag."
- "Once it&#39;s in the plastic bag, either form it with your hands or roll it out with a rolling pin. Rest the dough in the fridge for 5-10 minutes."
- "If you rolled it out with a rolling pin, cut into 2 mm cubes with a cookie cutter or a knife. If you formed the bars yourself, cut them with a kitchen knife into 2 mm slices."
- "If you added in too many nuts and the dough won&#39;t come together, push down firmly with your hands and form it into a ball. This should enable you to shape the cookies."
- "Next, bake them in a preheated oven at 350℉/180℃. (adjust the recipe based on your own oven.)"
- "You can also put them on a heat resistant plate and microwave for 50 seconds at 1300 W! It will only take 10 minutes to make the cookies this way."
- "I let the cookies cool slightly, so they become deliciously crunchy."

<i>Before you jump to Simple &amp; Cruncy Pancake Mix Cookies in 30 Minutes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Working out at the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Drink water, not other beverages. Having a soda or cup of coffee from time to time won't hurt you too badly. It is, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. Having water instead of other types of drinks is a good way to aid your body in its health and hydration. This also helps you decrease your caloric intake by hundreds of points without requiring you to buy and eat gross diet foods. Successful weight loss efforts often depend exclusively on water intake.

There are a whole lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
