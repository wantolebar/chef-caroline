<i>Before you jump to Roasted broccli &amp; sweet potato soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as economically as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. It's related to being practical, usually.
