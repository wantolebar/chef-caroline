recipeingredient:
- "2 cups flour"
- "1/4 cup sugar"
- "2 teaspoons yeast"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon nutmeg optional"
- " Vegetable oil for frying"
- " Warm water for mixing to a sticky consistency"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sieve the flour and add the dry ingredients including the yeast. Mix properly. Pour in the warm water to get a sticky dough then cover it and leave to rise in a warm place for about an hour. In the meantime, boil 10 or 11 eggs and peel off the shells when they&#39;ve all cooled down."
- "Get the dough which would have doubled in size and cut out a little bit. The dough will be sticky and a little bit difficult to work with so oil your hands with shortening or wet it very slightly with water so prevent it from sticking to your hands."
- "Wrap the dough around an egg and place in hot oil over medium heat. You cannot do them all before placing them in the fire so you need to work a little bit fast. As you wrap it in dough, you place in the oil. Also keep an eye on the ones in the oil so you flip them when brown. The dough rises further while frying so it will be puffier than you think."

<i>Before you jump to Egg rolls 2 recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthful.

When you go grocery shopping, be smart about it. If you make smart decisions when you are shopping for your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to deal with a chaotic store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You’re going to go home and cook what you already have. Your house should be stored with healthy foods and ingredients. This makes it easy to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are a lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your lifestyle choices. It’s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
