<i>Before you jump to Pure VEGAN- Chickpeas Omelette (Without Eggs) or Chilla 💁🏻‍♀️ recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as efficiently as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
