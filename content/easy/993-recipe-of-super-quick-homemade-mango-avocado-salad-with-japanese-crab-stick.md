The typical light bulbs are the incandescent style, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Utilizing these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to acquire the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. This also occurs in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
