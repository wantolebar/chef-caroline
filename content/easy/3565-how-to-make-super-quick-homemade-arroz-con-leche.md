<i>Before you jump to arroz con leche recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a place to start as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. You really need to change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The kitchen lights specifically will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Certainly this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that hard. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
