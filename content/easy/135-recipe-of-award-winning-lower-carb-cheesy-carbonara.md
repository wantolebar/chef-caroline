Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that difficult. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
