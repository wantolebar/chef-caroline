<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as efficiently as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that tough. It's about being practical, usually.
