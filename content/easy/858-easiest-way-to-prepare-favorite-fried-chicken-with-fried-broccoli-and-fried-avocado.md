<i>Before you jump to Fried Chicken 🍗 with fried broccoli 🥦 and fried avocado 🥑 recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Do this for your house, not merely the kitchen. You should change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The kitchen lights especially will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
