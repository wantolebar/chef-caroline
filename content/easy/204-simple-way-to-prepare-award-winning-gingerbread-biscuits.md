<i>Before you jump to Gingerbread Biscuits recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, of course. It's about being functional, most of the time.
