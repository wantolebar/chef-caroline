<i>Before you jump to Easy Peasy Shepherd&#39;s Pie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
