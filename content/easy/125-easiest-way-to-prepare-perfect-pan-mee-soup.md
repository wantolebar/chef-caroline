<i>Before you jump to Pan Mee Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to operate as often.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
