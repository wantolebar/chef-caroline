<i>Before you jump to Chilli tofu/ cottage cheese recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Let us begin with something really easy, changing the actual light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent style, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more initially, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Using these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Together with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite straightforward to live green, all things considered. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
