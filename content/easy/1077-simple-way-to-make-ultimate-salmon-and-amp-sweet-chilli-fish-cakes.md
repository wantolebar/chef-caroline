<i>Before you jump to Salmon &amp; Sweet Chilli Fish Cakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
