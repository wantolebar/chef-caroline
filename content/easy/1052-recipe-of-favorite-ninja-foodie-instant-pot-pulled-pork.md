<i>Before you jump to Ninja Foodie/ Instant Pot Pulled Pork recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Probably the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. Typically, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
