It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently.

The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.
