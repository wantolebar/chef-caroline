recipeingredient:
- "2-2.5 pounds pork country ribs shoulderbutt picnic shoulder cut into 15 to 2 inch cubes"
- "2 Tablespoons minced garlic 3 to 4 cloves"
- "1/4-1/3 cup tightly packed brown sugar depending on how sweet you like your food dark preferable light ok"
- "1/8 cup fish sauce"
- "1 green onion chopped"
- "1 1/2 cups sliced onion about 1 small"
- "3/4 cup water"
- "2 Tablespoons soy sauce"
- "2 Tablespoons vinegar Distilled white apple cider or even red or white wine will work"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, combine the pork with the garlic, brown sugar, fish sauce and green onion. Mix thoroughly to ensure even distribution of the seasonings. The best way to do it is just to get in there with your hands and massage the pig. Time permitting, let the pork marinate for 20 minutes or so to allow the seasoning to penetrate the meat."
- "In deep skillet or pot, heat 2 Tablespoons of a neutral flavored oil over medium high heat and sear the pork, 4 or 5 pieces at a time (don&#39;t want to crowd the cooking surface) until the fatty bits get a rich, dark, caramel color, 2 to 2.5 minutes per side. This is one of those rare instances in which you could actually put the seared pork back into the bowl with the uncooked pork without worrying about contamination because all of it is going back into the pot to cook for a long time."
- "After the pork is seared, add the onions into the pot and saute until they just begin to become translucent, about 2 minutes. This quick saute develops the flavor of the onion and helps it hold some shape during the long simmer."
- "Put the pork back in the pot, and increase the heat to medium high. Add the water, soy sauce and vinegar, stir to ensure they get evenly distributed, and bring to a gentle boil (i.e., the liquid is bubbling gently and consistently but not so actively that it splatters)."
- "Reduce the heat to medium low and cover the pot. Simmer 45 to 50 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes or so to ensure that the meat gets evenly seasoned and cooked. Because heat accumulates, watch for signs that it&#39;s getting too high (the aforementioned splattery bubbling) and adjust back down if that happens.  At this point, the meat should be fork tender. If not, cover and simmer another 5 minutes or so."
- "Once the meat is fork tender, uncover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer another 15 minutes to reduce, thicken and further caramelize the braising liquid. Stir every 5 minutes to further ensure even seasoning and cooking.  If you refrigerate the leftovers, you&#39;ll find that the braising liquid becomes gelatinous due to the collagen from the pork. Just give it a warming on the stove or a zap in the microwave, and it&#39;s back to its saucy goodness in no time.  Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Vietnamese Caramelized Pork recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle demands. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Water is the most effective beverage out there. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every once in a while isn’t a terrible idea. It is, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. When you decide on water over other beverages you are helping your body stay very healthy and hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories away from your diet— without having to deal with terrible tasting diet food. Effective weight loss efforts often depend solely on water ingestion.

There are many things you can go after to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. Little things, when done every single day, can do a great deal to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
