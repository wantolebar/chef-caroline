recipeinstructions:
- "If you have a whole cut, ask butcher to trim some fat off.  If not, trim it yourself.  Leave a thin layer for flavor.   Wash and dry brisket.  Sprinkle pepper, garlic, onion powder and thyme over both sides of brisket.  Put small amount of olive oil in bottom of roaster.  If necessary, slice brisket in half to fit.  Note:  after its done, brisket will have shrunk about 1/5-1/4, so judge whether you need to cut it.  Turn burners on stove onto medium, and place roaster on burners.  Brown brisket on both sides.  If your roaster isn&#39;t flame-proof, brown it in something that is."
- "Place sliced onions on bottom of roaster, and place brisket on top of it.  Sprinkle carrots and mushrooms (if using) under, and around brisket.  Sprinkle onion soup mix over meat.  Pour red wine over all.  Spoon tomato paste around brisket, and mix with wine as best you can.  Add remaining ingredients around meat.  Take sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil, and seal tightly all around.  Place in 350°F oven for 90 minutes, and take out, open and flip.  Check liquid level.  If it seems to be drying out, or at some time in oven smells like it is (burning smell), add more Warner or beef broth."
- "After first 90 minutes, flip and bake for another 90 minutes.  Take out of oven after 3 hours, and cool for 10 minutes or so.  Take out of pan and place on cutting board with runnels to catch the liquid.  Brisket now needs to be sliced  across the grain.  If you have doubts as to where this is, ask butcher when you first purchase it.  Slice meat thinly, and place each on plate.  When done. Slide. Slicers into liquid and recover with foil tightly.  Bake for 1 hour more."
- "It is best to make this the day before, and refrigerate overnight.  You can lift off any fat very easily.  I always slice, then refrigerate overnight, and finish the the last hour of cooking tome on the day I want to serve it.  Delicious, even when it falls apart.  I even freeze any leftover gravy to use later.  Serves approximately 10-12, especially if you have a 5lb.brisket. Takes 4 hours in total"

<i>Before you jump to Mom&#39;s Holiday Brisket recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Perhaps the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, of course. It's about being practical, usually.
