<i>Before you jump to Grilled Pork Ribs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Especially if you ensure that the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, of course. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
