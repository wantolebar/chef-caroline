- "(For Chiles Rellenos): rinse and pat dry all chiles, place on a baking sheet, put in broiler for 3-4min, flip the peppers, cook another 3-4min (youll see them blister and toast like the vegetables). As soon as they come out put them in a bowl. And cover with plastic wrap (the skin will loosen up with the steam and make it easier to peel off later) leave in there for 15-20min so you can handle without burning yourself."

- "On a flat plate add the flour (for coating peppers) and add salt TN and pepper to the flour."
- "Take out the poblanos, peel the skin off (as much as you can)--they may tear, its ok, try to keep them as whole as you can. Use a sharp knife to cut the stem and attached seed comb from the top of each pepper."
- "Cut the mozarella cheese slices from the large block. As thick as you want. Stuff each pepper with as much cheese as you want."
- "Heat up oil (high) in a pan"
- "Roll the stuffed peppers in flour, coat all over. *check the oil heat by sprinkling a pinch of flour and seeing if it sizzles* and then dip and heavily coat the peppers in the egg mixture, coat as much as you can, the more the egg the better :^) quickly toss in hot oil. Watch egg spread out underneath the peppers."
- "With a large spoon, spoon hot oil over the pepper and use the same spoon to help fold the spread out egg from under the egg over the top of the pepper. You will begin to notice its browning on the bottom sides, now flip the pepper over, repeat until it browns golden color and feels crispy. Take out and place on strainer with kitchen towels to absorb excess oil."
- "Serve over salsa and with your favorite sides (refried beans, red rice, etc..)"

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows.

Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Making use of these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills.
