<i>Before you jump to Oregano veg stew with Pork belly slices recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
