recipeingredient:
- "4 Gruyere or comte cheese grated"
- "3 ParmigianoReggiano grated"
- "2 cup heavy cream"
- "4 clove garlic minced"
- "1 1/2 tbsp fresh thyme chopped"
- " salt  pepper"
- "3 large russet potatoes thinly sliced"
- "2 tbsp unsalted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400°F. Combine cheeses in a large bowl. Transfer 1/3 of cheese mixture to a separate bowl and set aside. Add cream, garlic and thyme to cheese mixture. Season generously with salt and pepper. Add potato slices and toss with your hands until every slice is coated with cream mixture, making sure to separate any slices that are sticking together to get the cream mixture in between them."
- "Grease a 2-quart casserole dish with butter. Pick up a handful of potatoes, organizing them into a neat stack, and lay them in the casserole dish with their edges aligned vertically. Continue placing potatoes in the dish, working around the perimeter and into the center until all the potatoes have been added. The potatoes should be very tightly packed. If necessary, slice an additional potato, coat with cream mixture, and add to casserole. Pour the excess cream/cheese mixture evenly over the potatoes until the mixture comes halfway up the sides of the casserole. You may not need all the excess liquid."
- "Cover dish tightly with foil and transfer to the oven. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until the top is pale golden brown, about 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove from oven, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and return to oven. Bake until deep golden brown and crisp on top, about 30 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let rest for a few minutes, and serve."
- "Note: Because of variation in the shape of potatoes, the amount of potato that will fit into a single casserole dish varies. Longer, thinner potatoes will fill a dish more than shorter, rounder potatoes. When purchasing potatoes, buy a few extra in order to fill the dish if necessary. Depending on exact shape and size of potatoes and casserole dish, you may not need all of the cream mixture."

<i>Before you jump to Cheesy Hasselback Potato Gratin recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a spot to begin with as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen area. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The kitchen lights specifically will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in different rooms, not merely the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, more often than not.
