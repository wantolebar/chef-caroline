recipeinstructions:

- "When sausage is cooked through take them out and set aside. This makes room for the pasta to cook. Now add the pasta, keep moving it around so it doesn&#39;t stick. Your cooking the pasta in the stock. The pasta will absorb the flavor while cooking. The starch in the pasta also thickens the stock creating a sauce."
- "You can add a little water if you think its getting too dry. When the pasta is cooked there should be enough sauce that you can drizzle over when serving bit not so much that the pasta is swimming. Add the meatballs back in and serve."
- "Zucchini (optional) I have a vegetable peeler with grooves in it. When you run it through the veg it creates long skinny spaghetti shaped zucchini.  I add this in just before the pasta is done cooking. This bulks up the pasta a bit and tastes wonderful."

<i>Before you jump to Sausage and Peppers Pasta (one pot) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
