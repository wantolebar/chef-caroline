recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare your marinade by getting your wet ingredients into a bowl. Add the dry ingredients and whisk vigorously. Dump into a large freezer bag along with beef. Marinade at least 2 hours. Turn the bag over half way through. I don’t know if there is science behind it, but it makes me feel better."
- "Remove beef from fridge and get it on the skewers. Put a little oil in a pan and get it hot. You can cook down the remaining marinade as a sauce. I don’t recommend going heavy on it though. Just a drizzle at the end."
- "Cook the beef on a Med-High setting for about 3 minutes on one side and 2 minutes on the other. Use your judgement."
- "Boil the broccolini for about 3 minutes to get the bitterness out. Immediately submerge in cold water."
- "Get the chilli oil hot with the garlic and ginger. Add in the broccolini. Heat it with the fish sauce and seasonings. Pan fry until fork tender, but leave a little crunch."
- "Drizzle a little of the reduced marinade on the beef. Serve with white rice."

<i>Before you jump to Garlic Ginger Beef and Broccolini recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, nevertheless it will save you money to use it over your oven. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
