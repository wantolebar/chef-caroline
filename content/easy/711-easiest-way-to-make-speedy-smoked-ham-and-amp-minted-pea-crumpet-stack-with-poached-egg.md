- "Gently crack the egg into a small bowl, ensuring the yolk is still intact."
- "Place the crumpets in the toaster and begin to toast them to your preference. In a small saucepan or in the microwave heat the mushy peas until warm. Season with a little salt and pepper. Stir through a good pinch of dried mint."
