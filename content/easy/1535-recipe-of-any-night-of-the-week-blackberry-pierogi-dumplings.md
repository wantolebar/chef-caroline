recipeinstructions:
- "Let&#39;s start with the dough. This is the kind for boiling."
- "Prepare the flour, salt and oil, boil a cup of water and let it cool down for a minute."
- "Mix the flour and salt, add oil and slowly, little by little add the hot water as you start kneading. Be careful not to burn your hand. The dough will be &#34;feathery&#34; at first, but don&#39;t worry, just knead."
- "Once the dough is uniform, not sticky and clay-like, cover with a dry cloth and let it rest for 10-15 minutes."
- "In the meantime, you can make the filling. If you&#39;re making with jam, you can skip the next step."
- "You can make the filling by mixing the fruit with starch. I used frozen blackberries here. They were pretty big and not too sweet, so I also added a little sugar. The filling should be pudding-like and not watery."
- "After the dough has rested, sprinkle some flour on your kneading board (if you don&#39;t have a kneading board, sprinkle flour on some clean, sturdy, flat surface) and get ready for a workout."
- "Using a rolling pin, make the dough into a thin, uniformly flat layer."
- "You may want to flip it from time to time and make sure you spread it in all directions. By the way, my fitbit recorded a relatively heavy workout. Feels like doing pushups."
- "Using a cup or small bowl, cut the dough into circles. Whatever is left over, you can sprinkle with water, flour and knead again for more circles."
- "Now for some arts and crafts. Take each circle, put some filling in the middle (your filling isn&#39;t watery, is it?). Now, use a wet finger to make the edges sticky and fold in half. When folded, squeeze the edges shut with your fingers or a fork. Be careful about the corners - it&#39;s where the filling leaks."
- "Now, gently put the dumplings in 4-5 cups of salted, boiling water. Make sure they don&#39;t stick to the bottom, or to each other. Leave them boiling until they float."
- "This is awesome by the way - these things float when they&#39;re ready!"
- "Now, take the dumplings out and let them drip and steam out. Serve with some yoghurt (for the calorie-conscious) or cream (for special occasions) and sugar. I used brown sugar and some leftover berries here."

<i>Before you jump to Blackberry pierogi (dumplings) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.

Be sensible when you do your food shopping. Making good decisions when shopping for food means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to cope with a hectic store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You’re going to go home and cook what you have in the cupboards. Fill your cupboards with nutritious foods. In this way, even when you determine that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are a whole lot of things that factor into getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. You need to help to make your body as strong it can be.
