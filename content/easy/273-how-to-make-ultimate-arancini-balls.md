Continue with the rest of the risotto until it has all been used up."
- "In a large pot, add the cooking oil (enough to cover the balls). Let the oil heat up on a medium heat Tip: to test if the oil is hot enough drop a small piece of breadcrumb into the pot, if the breadcrumb sizzles, it’s ready. Place about 3-4 balls into the frying pot at a time and deep fry, turning every few minutes with chopsticks or tongs to cook evenly. Cook until golden brown all over."
- "Place and transfer the fried risotto balls onto a plate lined with paper towels to drain off the excess oil. Repeat frying process till all of the risotto balls have been fried. Place fried risotto balls onto a serving plate and lightly sprinkle with some coarse sea salt (optional). Eat immediately while hot and serve with a side salad and condiments like aeoli or mustard."
