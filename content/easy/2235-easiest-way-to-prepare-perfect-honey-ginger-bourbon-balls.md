<i>Before you jump to Honey Ginger Bourbon Balls recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that hard. Typically, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
