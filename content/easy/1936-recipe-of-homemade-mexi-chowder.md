<i>Before you jump to Mexi Chowder recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Let us begin with something quite simple, changing the actual light bulbs. Accomplish this for the entire house, not merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. The kitchen lights especially are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in different rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
