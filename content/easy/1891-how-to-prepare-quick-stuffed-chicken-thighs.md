Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as efficiently as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.
