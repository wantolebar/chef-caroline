recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven to 180°C / 350°F / gas mark 4."
- "In a bowl, loosely work together all of the helzel ingredients to form a coarse, crumble-like mixture."
- "For ease, I stand the bird in the sink and spoon the helzel mix into the body cavity. The cavity should be loosely packed but well filled. You can secure the skin with wooden cocktail sticks or a skewer."
- "If there is sufficient skin around the neck of the bird, you can also fill this cavity with helzel and sew it up with a needle and thread, otherwise cover with tinfoil. (In our house it is a treat to get the well-roasted, crispy skin with the cotton attached.) Any excess helzel can be cooked as below."
- "Weigh the stuffed bird and use this cooking guide: 1.0 – 1.3kg: 1½ – 1¾ hours 1.3 – 1.8kg: 1¾ – 2 hours 1.8 – 2.7kg: 2 – 2¼ hours"
- "Rub the outside of the bird with oil and salt."
- "Sit it on a wire rack, breast side down, over a roasting tin containing the cup of water and chopped onion."
- "Roast for one hour, then turn it over and finish the cooking breast side up."
- "While it’s roasting, make the gravy: fry the mushrooms in oil until they start to brown then combine them with a tablespoon of plain flour."
- "Add the juices from the roasting tin, top up with chicken stock if necessary, and stir well."
- "Bring to a boil. Thicken with the cornflour and water if you wish. Check the seasoning."
- "Allow it to simmer, covered, for 15 – 20 minutes."
- "After roasting, the bird should be golden brown. If the skin has not yet crisped, give it another 10 – 15 minutes at 200°C / 390°F / gas mark 6."
- "Serve the chicken with a spoonful of helzel, plenty of mushroom gravy, and vegetables. Helen’s roast potatoes and/or potato kugel are essential. Find recipes for both of these at www.justnotkosher.com"
- "If you are cooking chicken portions (with nothing to stuff) and you’d like helzel alongside, wrap the mixture in a loose tinfoil parcel, secure the edges, and place in an oven dish half-filled with hot water."
- "Cook at 180°C / 350°F / gas mark 4 for about 1½ hours, topping up the water as necessary."
- "Remove from the oven, carefully drain off the water, open the parcel and serve as above."
