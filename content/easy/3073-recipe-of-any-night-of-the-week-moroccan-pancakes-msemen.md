<i>Before you jump to Moroccan pancakes Msemen recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of electricity is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
