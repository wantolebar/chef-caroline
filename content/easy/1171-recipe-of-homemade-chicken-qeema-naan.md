- "3 tbspn sesame seeds"
- " Melted butter to bursh over the naan"
recipeinstructions:
- "To make the Naan: In a large bowl add 1 cup warm milk and one packet (7g) of yeast. Allow the yeast to activate for a few minutes before adding the following one at a time and stirring in between: oil, yoghurt, salt, sugar then eggs. Finally add in the flour and knead the dough until it is combined. Allow this to rise, covered, for about 1.5-2hrs"
- "For the raw keema filling: Mix all the ingredients together well and set aside"
- "For the cooked keema filling. Add some oil into a pan. Add in all the ingredients aside from the onion and coriander and fry on high till the meat has changed colour. This is usually enough time for the chicken to have just cooked. For lamb/beef, you may need to add half a cup of water and simmer on low until the meat is cooked. Please dry out ALL the moisture from the keema because the Naans will break if the mixture is wet. Add the onions and coriander at the end"
- "To assemble: Evenly divide the Naan dough into 5 portions. Roll one portion out till it&#39;s about the size of your hand when stretched open. Using a spoon, load in the keema filling."
- "Using your fingers, begin to pinch in the sides of the dough towards the centre whilst at the same time pinching all the sides together at the centre"
- "Seal the Naan dough using a combination of pinching and flattening pressure from the palm of your hand."
- "Next, using a mix of your rolling pin and weight from your hands, roll out the Naan until your desired size. Try to avoid having the keema rip through the dough. If small holes appear, you can cover them by using some additional dough."
- "When it&#39;s at your desired size, sprinkle over some onions seeds and sesame seeds. Use a rolling pin to simply apply pressure to get the seeds to stick to the dough"
- "(optional) Use the end of your rolling pin/a wooden spoon to pierce the Naan with holes all around the Naan"
- "For the Oven method: Transfer the Naan to a hot pan. Cook this for a few moments, until the bottom forms a brown skin, then transfer to a preheated oven and bake at the highest heat for 5 minutes."
- "For the pan method: Transfer the Naan to pan heated on medium. Cook the Naan and flip it on the other side. Keep doing this until the Naan has browned sufficiently"
- "Brush with warm butter immediately after taking off the heat"

<i>Before you jump to Chicken qeema naan recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of electrical power is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that tough. It's about being practical, usually.
