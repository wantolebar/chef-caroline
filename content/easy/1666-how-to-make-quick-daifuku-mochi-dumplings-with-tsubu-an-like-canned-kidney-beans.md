recipeingredient:
- "1 can Canned kidney beans"
- "200 grams Sugar I use light brown sugar"
- "1 Sea salt"
- " To make the daifuku mochi"
- "60 grams Shiratamako or Chinese mochiko"
- "60 grams Sugar"
- "120 grams Water"
- "1 for dusting Katakuriko or cornstarch"
recipeinstructions:
- "If the canned kidney beans don&#39;t contain additives or any other ingredient besides salt, combine the entire contents of the can with the sugar in a pot and bring to a boil. Otherwise, discard the liquid, add 1 tablespoon of water, and boil with the sugar."
- "When you can see the bottom of the pot, as shown in the photo, add the salt. Depending on the brand, the beans may already be salted, so adjust to taste. I prefer it on the salty side."
- "Since this the beans will be too large, cut them with kitchen scissors. You may also use a food processor, but it can be cumbersome to clean and the paste may stick to the sides."
- "The paste may be runnier than traditional an paste, but it should thicken once it is chilled. I let it sit overnight in the refrigerator."
- "To prepare the daifuku mochi: Combine the shiratamako and sugar in a heat-resistant dish. Gradually add the water little by little, and mix well."
- "Cover in plastic wrap, microwave for 2 minutes, mix, then microwave again for 1 minute. If it still hasn&#39;t become translucent, microwave for 1 more minute."
- "When mixing, use a wet spatula. Place the daifuku mochi on a dusted work surface, flatten it out, and divide it into 4-6 equal pieces with a wet knife."
- "Roll each piece into a ball, flatten, then spoon out equal portions of the an paste and wrap them with the dough. Press down on the seam to seal, dust with plenty of katakuriko, and they&#39;re ready to serve."
- "Shiratamako can be found as &#34;mochiko&#34; or &#34;glutinous rice flour (imported from Thailand), or &#34;sticky rice flour&#34; in Asian specialty food shops."

<i>Before you jump to Daifuku (Mochi Dumplings) with Tsubu-an-Like Canned Kidney Beans recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is done, most people do not want to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Take the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a whole lot of things that factor into getting healthy. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being smart about the decisions you make each day is a start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also important. Don't forget that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. It is more about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
