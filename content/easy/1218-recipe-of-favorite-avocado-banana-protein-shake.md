<i>Before you jump to Avocado Banana Protein Shake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a little common sense.
