recipeinstructions:
- "3 days before cooking divide the wing quantity in half to thaw. Put 10 wings per gallon sized bag with 2 tbsp of the AP rub. As the wings thaw the ice will melt and mix with the rub and act as a brine."
- "Heat smoker to 275° F. I used a combination of charcoal and pecan wood."
- "Pat the wings dry and dust both sides with the rub mix. I didn&#39;t use a traditional style BBQ rub or my personal chicken rub mix recipe. I wanted them to have a lighter flavor and less of a bark than a brown sugar based rub gives so the sauces could act as the glaze."
- "Let sit for just few minutes with the rub before putting on the smoker."
- "Smoke them for 1 hour."
- "Put the teriyaki sauce in a small bowl and in another bowl mix 2 parts BBQ sauce and 1 part hot sauce. Let these come to room temperature. I did 10 teriyaki and 10 hot bbq."
- "After an hour flip and let cook for another half hour."
- "Flip again and sauce. After 10 minutes flip and sauce the other side."
- "Let them cook for another 10-15 minutes. The light rub will set and add a slight crispness like if fried. The sauce will be thick and smokey."
