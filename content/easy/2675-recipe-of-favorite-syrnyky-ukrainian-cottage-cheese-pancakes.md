It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. You get the greatest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
