<i>Before you jump to Irvixen&#39;s Pot Roast With Buttermilk Gravy (crock Pot) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Consider the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the selections you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about slimming down. You want your body to be strong too.
