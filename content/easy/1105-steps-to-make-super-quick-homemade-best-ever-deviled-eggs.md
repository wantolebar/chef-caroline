<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Probably the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. It's about being functional, more often than not.
