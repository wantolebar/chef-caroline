<i>Before you jump to Chicken and not Dumplings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is merely making use of common sense.
