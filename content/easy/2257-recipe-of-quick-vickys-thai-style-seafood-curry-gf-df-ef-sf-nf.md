<i>Before you jump to Vickys Thai-Style Seafood Curry, GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as effectively as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
