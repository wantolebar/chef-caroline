<i>Before you jump to Easy Pancake Mix Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about slimming down. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
