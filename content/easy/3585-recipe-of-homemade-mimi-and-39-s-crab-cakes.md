<i>Before you jump to Mimi&#39;s Crab Cakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Let's begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. This will go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than simply exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights especially will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This also happens in the rest of the house, but we are trying to save money in the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. A lot of it truly is basically using common sense.
