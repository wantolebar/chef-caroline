<i>Before you jump to Greens and Reds Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthful.

Consider the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. So many people choose the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get wholesome. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Wanting to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about reducing your weight. It’s about making your body as strong as it can be.
