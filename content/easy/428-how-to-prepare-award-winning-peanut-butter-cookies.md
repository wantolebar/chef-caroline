<i>Before you jump to Peanut Butter Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Especially if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
