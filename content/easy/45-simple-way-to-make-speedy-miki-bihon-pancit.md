<i>Before you jump to Miki Bihon Pancit recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

A massive amount of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, after all. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
