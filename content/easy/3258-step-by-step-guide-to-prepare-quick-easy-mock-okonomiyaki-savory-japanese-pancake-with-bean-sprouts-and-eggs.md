It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a little common sense.
