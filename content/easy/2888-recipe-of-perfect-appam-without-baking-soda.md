- " urad dal"

recipeinstructions:
- "Clean and soak all ingredients except salt for 5-6 hours. I am using Fenugreek seeds(vendhayam) instead of baking soda."
- "Grind the soaked ingredients in mixie jar, since the quantity is less. The consistency should be like idli batter. It&#39;s better to soak in the afternoon and grind during dinner time. Add required amount of salt and leave it for fermentation overnight."
- "Next day the batter will be fermented.Now take small portion in a bowl and add little water.It should be in running consistency."
- "Heat the appam pan.I am using non-stick pan.Add little oil and do spread the oil by spinning the pan slowly."
- "Once the pan is heated, keep it in low flame.Take one laddle batter and pour it in the pan and immediately spin the pan slowly either in clockwise or anticlockwise direction by holding the pan handle in your hands. You can spin twice or thrice for outer layer thickness. Make sure more batter is left in the middle of the pan after spinning."
- "Now cover it with the lid. Sides come off the pan and middle part will look soft like idli, once it&#39;s done.You don&#39;t need to turn the appam."
- "With a wooden spatula take the appam gently. Follow the above steps again to make appam again. Serve appam with coconut milk/ vegetable stew /white Kurma of your choice ðŸ™‚."
- "To notice:. 1. If batter is fermented properly, you can see many air bubbles popup while making appam(eg.like uthappam). 2.you can add oil while closing the lid,this gives crispy brown layer. 3.Dont over heat the pan and do not open the lid very often."
