recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the fish before applying the rub. Prepare the grill so that it reaches a temperature of 400°F."
- "Mix all dry spices together in a bowl. Once mixed, drizzle over fish and massage in with your hands. There is no real need to apply the rub to the underside where the skin is, so drizzle the rub only on the non-skin side and rub on top and the sides of the fish."
- "After all of the rub has been applied, add the olive oil. Make sure you split up the olive oil between the top of the fish and underneath where the skin is. This is to prevent the skin from sticking to the grill."
- "Once the grill is ready, throw the fish skin-side down on the grill for about 10 minutes. If you have a thicker piece of fish, after the 10 minutes, turn the heat down to about half to avoid overcooking any thinner pieces of the fish for about 2-3 more minutes. During the grilling, the flames may breach the grate and char the sides of the fish. This is OK."
- "Serve the fish fresh off the grill. The fish should flake easily if it is done."

<i>Before you jump to Grilled Salmon recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Take the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an attempt on the stairs. Even just a individual flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about losing weight. You need your body to be strong too.
