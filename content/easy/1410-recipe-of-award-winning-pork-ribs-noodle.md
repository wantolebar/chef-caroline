<i>Before you jump to Pork Ribs Noodle recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Why don't we begin with something quite simple, changing the actual light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more originally, these bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house at the same time. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
