Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as economically as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.
