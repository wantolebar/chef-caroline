recipeingredient:
- " PASTRY CREAM 1 12 cups whole milk 12 cup heavy cream 12 cup sugar divided Pinch of salt 3 Tbsp cornstarch 5 egg yolks 4 Tbsp cold butter cut into chunks 1 12 tsp vanilla extract"
- " PASTRY CRUST 1 egg yolk 1 Tbsp heavy cream 12 tsp vanilla 1 14 cups allpurpose flour 23 cup powdered sugar 14 tsp salt 8 Tbsp cold unsalted butter cut into chunks"
- " FRUIT TOPPING 3 kiwis peeled halved lengthwise and sliced 38inch thick 1012 strawberries hulled and sliced in half"
- " black grapes 4 cherries 12 cup apple jelly or apricot preserves warmed"
recipeinstructions:
- "üåªPASTRY CREAM Combine the milk, cream, and half of the sugar in a medium sauce pan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally until the liquid comes to a simmer. As the liquid heats, whisk together the remaining sugar, salt, cornstarch, and egg yolks in a medium bowl until light and creamy."
- "Once the milk mixture is hot, slowly whisk about 1 cup of the liquid into the egg mixture to temper the yolks. Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the hot milk mixture and reduce the heat to medium, continuing to cook while whisking constantly, until thickened and a few bubbled burst on the surface, about 30 seconds."
- "Remove the pastry cream from the heat and whisk in the butter and vanilla, then transfer to a bowl and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap placed directly onto the surface of the pastry cream so a skin doesn&#39;t form. Refrigerate until chilled and firm, about 3 hours."
- "üåªTART SHELL Whisk together the egg yolk, cream, and vanilla in a small bowl.  Combine the flour, powdered sugar, and salt in a food process and briefly process to combine. (if you have no food process so you can mix with hands) Add the cold butter pieces to the flour mixture and pulse to cut into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse meal, about 15 pulses."
- "While the food processor is running, add the liquid through the feed tube and continue to process just until the dough comes together around the blade.  Turn out the tart dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into a 6-inch disk, then wrap it tightly and refrigerate for 1 hour. Let sit out on the counter for 10 minutes to soften slightly before rolling out."
- "Roll out the pastry crust on a lightly floured surface until it is slightly larger than your tart pan. Carefully transfer the dough to the pan by rolling it onto the rolling pin, then gently easing the dough into the pan, pressing into the corners and fluted sides of the pan."
- "Run the rolling pin over the top of the pan so that the excess dough gets cut off on the edge of the pin, making a clean edge. Patch any edges that are too thin with excess dough, trimming away the edge again as necessary. Freeze the tart shell for 30 minutes."
- "When ready to bake the tart shell, heat oven to 375 degrees F. Press a double layer of foil into the frozen tart shell, covering the edges of the pan and filling the tart shell with pie weights (what is pie weight you can see my pics). Bake for 30 minutes, rotating halfway through, then carefully remove the pie weights and foil and bake another 5 to 10 minutes, until the tart shell is fully baked and golden. Cool completely before filling."
- "üåªTART ASSEMBLY When the tart shell is completely cooled, spread the pastry cream over the bottom of the shell. Arrange the all fruit as your desire.   Melt the jelly or preserves in a small saucepan or the microwave, stirring until smooth. Use a pastry brush to gently dab the melted jelly over the fruit. You may not use all of the jelly. Slice and serve."
- "‚úÖNotes &amp; Tips üí° I don‚Äôt have pie- weight so I used this Method as a pie-weight üëá    &gt; ‚Ä¢ Line the inside of your crust with foil or parchment paper, and fill it with dried beans or rice. Then, bake your crust according to the instructions in the recipe. (see all pictures step by step)"

<i>Before you jump to FRIUT TART: üçΩ recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we‚Äôre vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

When you go to the grocery store, be smart about it. Making good decisions when shopping for groceries means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. Think for a minute: you don't want to go to a chaotic grocery store or sit in a long line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to go to your apartment and make something from your kitchen. Fill your cupboards with healthy foods. This way, even when you determine that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. You need to make your body as strong you can make it.
