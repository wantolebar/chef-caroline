According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity.
