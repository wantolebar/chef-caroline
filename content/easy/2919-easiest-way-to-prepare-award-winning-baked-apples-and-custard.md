Although costing a little more initially, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Utilizing these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills.

And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house as well. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it truly is simply utilizing common sense.
