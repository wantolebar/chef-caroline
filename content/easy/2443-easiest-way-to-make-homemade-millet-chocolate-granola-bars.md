recipeingredient:
- "1 1/4 cups (100 grams) oats"
- "1/4 cup (20 grams) oats finely ground or 14 cup oat flour"
- "3/4 cup (60 grams) dried unsweetened shredded coconut"
- "1/3 cup (65 grams) millet flakes"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon optional"
- "1 cup about 140 grams chopped dried fruit"
- "1 cup (170 grams) chopped dark chocolate or chocolate chips"
- "1/4 cup (65 grams) peanut butter"
- "1/4 cup olive oil or coconut oil warmed until liquefied"
- "1/4 cup about 85 grams honey or golden syrup"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line an 8-by-8 inch square pan with two sheets of parchment paper, extending each up two sides, forming a “sling” for your bars to make them easy to remove."
- "In a large bowl, combine oats, oat flour or ground oats, coconut, millet, salt, cinnamon (if using), dried fruit and chocolate. In a separate, small bowl, whisk together peanut butter, oil and sweetener of choice until smooth."
- "Pour wet mixture into dry and stir until combined. Transfer to prepared pan, spreading until flat, then use an addition square of parchment paper to protect your hand as you press, press, pressthe ingredients tightly into all corners of the pan, until they can be pressed no flatter."
- "Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the tops are golden and the edges are light brown. Let cool completely before cutting; they’ll be even easier to cut without crumbling if you chill them in the fridge first, so feel free to cool them there."
- "Once cool, use the parchment “sling” to lift bars from pan and transfer to cutting board. Use a sharp, serrated knife in a very gentle sawing motion to cut bars into desired sizes (I usually go for 16 2×2-inch squares)."
- "Bars will keep at room temperature for up to a week in an airtight container"

<i>Before you jump to Millet Chocolate Granola Bars recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a spot to start as any. Do this for your house, not just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more initially, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The family spends major time in the kitchen, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen alone gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is basically making use of common sense.
