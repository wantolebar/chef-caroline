<i>Before you jump to Vegan/GF waffles recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Let us begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent style, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. You also have to obtain the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Obviously this also happens in different rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
