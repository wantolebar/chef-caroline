<i>Before you jump to Mini Chocolate Muffins recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as economically as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, after all. Typically, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
