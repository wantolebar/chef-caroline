<i>Before you jump to Spinach Lasagna Rolls
* vegetarian * recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that tough. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
