<i>Before you jump to Phirni
Indian creamy rice pudding recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Why don't we begin with something not that hard, changing the actual light bulbs. This will go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you should use them in place of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. This also happens in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. It's about being sensible, usually.
