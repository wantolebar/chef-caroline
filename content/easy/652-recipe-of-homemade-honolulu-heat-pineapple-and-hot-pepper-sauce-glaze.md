recipeingredient:
- "4 c. sugar"
- "1 c. apple cider vinegar"
- "1 c. pineapple juice"
- "3 Tbsp lemon juice"
- "3 Tbsp cornstarch mixed with a bit of water to make a slurry"
- "1 pineapple"
- "1 red bell pepper"
- "1 yellow bell pepper"
- "1 mango"
- "4 Naga Viper peppers"
- " optional 1 medium sweet onion"
recipeinstructions:
- "Create a simple syrup in a large pot by whisking the sugar, vinegar, pineapple juice and lemon juice over medium high heat until the sugar dissolves. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil for 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit while you prep the remaining ingredients."
- "Slice the pineapple in rings and grill them until the sugars begin to caramelize and creates grill marks on both sides."
- "Lightly char the skins of the Naga Vipers (or any hot peppers you choose) over an open flame or on a searing hot grill pan. Do not grill your red and yellow bell peppers in order to maintain some crunch and texture in the sauce. (roasting the pineapple and hot peppers will bring out their inherent sweetness and richness."
- "Make sure the Vipers are super finely chopped. If you want to tone down the heat slightly carefully remove the seeds. (I used my chopper to make sure the peppers were in super tiny pieces so no one bites into a large piece of super hot pepper.)"
- "Next, finely chop all fruit, peppers and onion into 1/4&#34; pieces (or smaller)."
- "Stir the remaining ingredients into the simple syrup you prepared earlier. Stir in the cornstarch (mixing with a few tablespoons of water first to create a slurry). Bring the mixture to a boil and the turn down the heat to simmer for 5-10 minutes. The consistency should be syrupy and chunky."

<i>Before you jump to Honolulu Heat (pineapple and hot pepper sauce/glaze) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Drink water, not other drinks. Sipping a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. Getting all your hydration from them is a horrendous idea. Choosing water as opposed to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories away from your diet— without having to be forced to eat terrible tasting diet food. Effective weight loss efforts often depend exclusively on water ingestion.

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. It has more to do with making your body as sturdy as it can be.
