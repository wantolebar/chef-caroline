It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle.
