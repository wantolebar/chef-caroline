<i>Before you jump to Pot Roast recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
