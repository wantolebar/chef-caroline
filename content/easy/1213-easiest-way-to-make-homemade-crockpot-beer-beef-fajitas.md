Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.
