Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a place get started on as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen area. You should upgrade your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Together with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. This likewise happens in the rest of the house, but we are trying to save money in the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
