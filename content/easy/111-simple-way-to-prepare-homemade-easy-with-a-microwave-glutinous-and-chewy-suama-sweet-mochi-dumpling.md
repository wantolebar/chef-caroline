recipeingredient:
- " Joshinko"
- " Sugar"
- " Water"
- " Red food coloring optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make things ready: If you are using food coloring, dissolve a tiny amount in water using a toothpick or similar tool. Moisten a kitchen towel and wring out tightly."
- "Put all the ingredients except for the water in a heatproof bowl, and mix with chopsticks."
- "Add water and mix. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and microwave for 3 minutes at 600w."
- "Take the bowl out and mix with the chopsticks again. Cover again and microwave for another 2 minutes (It may be lumpy at this point but don&#39;t worry, just mix it up and it will be fine.)"
- "Take the dough out of the bowl onto a wrung out kitchen towel. Knead the dough over the kitchen towel. This prevents your hands from getting sticky, and the dough doesn&#39;t stick to the cloth either."
- "Form the dough into a log, wrap in plastic wrap, then wrap in a sushi rolling mat (maikusu) to shape, and secure with a rubber band. Leave to cool to room temperature, and it&#39;s done. You don&#39;t have to use a sushi mat."
- "This is how it looks wrapped in the sushi rolling mat and secured with elastic bands, while cooling down. If you don&#39;t have a sushi rolling mat, just leave it to cool down in the plastic wrap."
- "I added leftover kanoko (another type of traditional sweet) to this version. This was delicious too."
- "Slice the suama log while it&#39;s still warm and shape into hearts. It&#39;s nice to make suama like this once in a while."

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as economically as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it really is basically making use of common sense.
