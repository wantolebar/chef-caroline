<i>Before you jump to 肉骨茶 Herbal Pork Rib Soup (Bak Kut Teh) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Drink water, not other beverages. Soda and coffee, when ingested in small amounts, aren't that bad. It is, however, a bad idea to solely drink soda or coffee. When you pick out water more than other beverages you are helping your body stay very healthy and hydrated. This also helps you reduce your caloric intake by hundreds of points without requiring you to buy and eat disgusting diet foods. Water is often one of the keys to successful weight-loss and healthfulness.

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It is more about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
