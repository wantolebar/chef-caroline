<i>Before you jump to Steak fish (milkfish) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

You may prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
