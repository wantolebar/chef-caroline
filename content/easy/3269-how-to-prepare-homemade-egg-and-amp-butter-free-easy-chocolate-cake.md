<i>Before you jump to Egg &amp; Butter-Free Easy Chocolate Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not wish to go to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Go up the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get wholesome. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your healthfulness. It is more about making your body as powerful as it can be.
