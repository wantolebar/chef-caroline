<i>Before you jump to Chicken shwarma recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. It's related to being sensible, usually.
