- "Drop the dumpling batter by small spoonfuls over the top of the slow cooker contents until it&#39;s all used up. Keep in mind that the dumplings will expand as they cook, so leave a bit of space between them. Place the lid back on and cook on high heat for an additional 35 minutes - 1 hour."
- "Once it&#39;s ready, the soup should have thickened and a toothpick inserted into the dumplings should come out clean. Once it&#39;s ready, serve immediately. Store any leftovers in the fridge."

<i>Before you jump to Chicken and Dumplings - Slow Cooker recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is done, most people do not want to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be irritating. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Go up the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. It’s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
