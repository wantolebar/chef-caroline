<i>Before you jump to Lee&#39;s Southern Hashbrown Casserole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
