<i>Before you jump to Potato and onion dauphinoise recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
