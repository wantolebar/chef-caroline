<i>Before you jump to Vegan Banana and Walnut Muffinsüçå recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

A massive amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
