recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the apple into 8 parts and then cut each part in half.

The heating time may vary depending on the size of your apple chunks so adjust accordingly."

- "Leave to proof for 40 - 50 minutes."

- "Here I tried adding some cheese along with the apple."
- "Place the dough seam-down in aluminium cups or muffin cups.Rub on some bread flour on your index finger and make some dents in the middle of the dough until you can feel the apple. Leave to proof a second time for 30 minutes at 35°C. The photo shows the dough before proving."
- "Once proofed, stick a piece of pretzel stick in each dent to make an apple stem and glaze. Bake for 12 minutes in an oven preheated to 180°C. (Our oven is a gas oven, electric ovens tend to be a bit weaker so adjust the baking time as appropriate). The bread will come out more shiny if you use a glaze so I recommend using one."

<i>Before you jump to Apple Bread recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
