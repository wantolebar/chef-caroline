<i>Before you jump to Breakfast Casserole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, of course. It's about being sensible, more often than not.
