- "100 Gram Edible Gum"
- "400 Gram Jaggery"
- "100 Gram Dessicated Coconut"
- "180-200 Gram Desi Ghee clarified butter"
- "5 Gram Green Cardamom"
- "5 Gram BlackWhite Pepper corns"
- "5 Gram Dried Ginger Powder sonth"
recipeinstructions:
- "Clean, wash and dry the methi(fenugreek seeds) and grind it to a fine powder then soak it in the milk for 3-4 hours. This will help methi granules to puff up and the tanginess of methi will almost goes away."
- "In a pan add 3-4 tbsp ghee and roast the soaked methi. Roast it continuously otherwise it will stick to the pan. Roast it till it gets a beautiful brown colour and is aromatic. It will take almost 12-15 minutes. Transfer it to a big bowl."
- "In the same pan add 2 tbsp ghee and roast the wheat flour till golden brown and the beautiful aroma starts to come. This will take 10-12 minutes. Do this process on a low flame stirring continuously and keep a constant eye on it. Transfer it to the same methi bowl."
- "Again in the same pan add 2-3 tbsp ghee and roast the edible gums. Don&#39;t roast it on a high heat or in a very hot oil. It burns within no time. If your edible gum has big chunks then break it into small pieces then roast. It will puff up and become off white in colour and will be very crunchy. Transfer this to a seprate bowl to cool down."
- "Now add 2 tbsp ghee and roast the almonds on medium flame for about 5 minutes and take it out."
- "Again in the same pan add 2-3 tbsp ghee and on medium flame roast the dessicated coconut till aromatic and turns golden brown. It will take 4-5 minutes. Transfer it to a separate bowl."
- "In the same pan add 3 tbsp ghee and add the jaggery and melt to on low heat stirring in between until it melts completely. It will take 8-10 minutes."
- "Meanwhile grind all the ingredients which we have roasted the edible gum, almonds and the three spices but grind everything separately and add to the big bowl of roasted methi and wheat flour. Grind everything to a fine powder except the edible gum in case you like the big chunks of it in between munching on the laddoo otherwise grind it also to a fine powder."
- "For dessicated coconut it&#39;s upto you whether you want to grind or not. If you like the coconut chunk coming in mouth while eating laddoo then don&#39;t grind otherwise grind like I do and add to the mixture."
- "When everything is done then add all the mixture to the melted jaggery and mix really well and cook it for 5 minutes. Then off the flame and transfer the mixture to the big bowl again."
- "Allow it to cool down a bit or to the point where you can easily make balls or laddoos out of it. Then take a handful of mixture and press it really tight. When it get tightened then roll it between your palms in a circular motion to give a circle shape or the laddoo shape."
- "Like so make all the laddoos. It will be 34-35 in numbers. Eat one daily. When completely cools down store in an air tight container on room temperature for almost 3 months. Make the size of the laddoos big or small as you like."
- "Relish these tasty medicinal laddoos with your friends and family."
- "Do comment for any queries. Happy winters ðŸ˜Š"

<i>Before you jump to Methi Coconut laddoo recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle involves. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesnâ€™t have to be a pain. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Walk up the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. Even just a individual flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. You really want your body to be strong too.
