<i>Before you jump to Buttery Bourbon Steak recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, nevertheless it will save you money to use it over your oven. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
