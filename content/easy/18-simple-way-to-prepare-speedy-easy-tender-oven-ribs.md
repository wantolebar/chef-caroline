<i>Before you jump to easy tender oven ribs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as efficiently as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, all things considered. A lot of it truly is merely making use of common sense.
