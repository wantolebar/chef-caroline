recipeingredient:
- "1 steak Beef sirloin"
- "1 dash Salt and pepper"
- "1 Cooking oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Don&#39;t let thin-cut steak warm to room temperature! Just before you cook it, season both sides of the steak evenly with salt and pepper."
- "Add a generous amount of oil, enough to almost cover the steak, in a pan that&#39;s just big enough for the steak to fit in. Heat up pan over medium heat."
- "When the oil is hot (just before it starts smoking), add the meat and shallow-fry the first side for 1 minute. Turn and fry the other side in the same way."
- "Put a couple of vegetable scraps or crumbled pieces of foil in the pan and put the steak on top."
- "If using vegetable scraps, it looks like this."
- "Cover the steak with aluminium foil, turn the heat down to low and steam-cook for 5 minutes over low heat."
- "After 5 minutes, wrap the meat in foil and take it out of the pan. Leave for another 5 minutes to rest and cook in residual heat."
- "By doing this, the meat will cook through to the middle so that it&#39;s rare, but not raw."
- "The thinly cut steak is done. It will be rare to medium rare, depending on how thick it is and how long you cooked it."
- "If you cut through it, you&#39;ll see that the surface is cooked through, but the inside is medium rare. It&#39;s not raw, which is what this recipe achieves."
- "The steak I used this time was about 1 cm thick. If your steak is thinner than that, reduce the steam-cooking time and let the meat rest and cook in residual heat."

<i>Before you jump to Dinner For Bachelors/Bachelorettes: How to Cook a Steak recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Select water over other drinks. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every once in a while isn’t a bad idea. It is definitely, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. Choosing water as opposed to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Water is typically one of the keys to really slimming down and becoming really healthy.

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being smart about the decisions you make each day is a start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about losing weight. You need to make your body as strong you can make it.
