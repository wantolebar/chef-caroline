<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s Chilly King Crab Lump Meat Salad Sandwiches recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
