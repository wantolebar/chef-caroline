Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as effectively as they should.

The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.
