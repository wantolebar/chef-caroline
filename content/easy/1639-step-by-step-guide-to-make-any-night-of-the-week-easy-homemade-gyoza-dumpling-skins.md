- "100 grams Flour Cake flour is supposed to be the best"
- "60 to 85 ml Boiling water depends on the type of flour apparently"

recipeinstructions:
- "Put the flour in a bowl and add the hot water little by little until a crumbly dough is formed. Don&#39;t keep adding hot water even if some is left over; test the texture of the dough instead."
- "The dough will come together as you knead it. If the dough is too stiff, add a little bit of hot water until it&#39;s just a bit stiffer than the texture of your earlobe to adjust."
- "When the dough comes together, roll it into a ball and wrap in plastic film. Leave it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes, and make the filling in the meantime. See."
- "Take the dough out. Dust your work surface and knead the dough again, and roll it out with a rolling pin. (The more you knead it, the more pliable and chewy it will become.)"
- "Cut the dough out with a circular cutter. If you don&#39;t have one just use a mug or glass as a cutter."
- "Flour the skins generously to prevent them from sticking to each other. The gyoza skins are done."
- "Wrap them around the filling, and line them up in a shallow floured stainless steel container.  Make sure to close up the dumplings or the meat juices will leak out while cooking!"
- "Then just pan fry them. See how to do this here -  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143867-how-to-cook-crispy-and-juicy-gyoza-dumplings"
- "Put any leftover dumplings in the stainless steel container, cover with plastic wrap and into the freezer."
- "When the gyoza dumplings are frozen, put them one by on into a ziplock bag and store in the freezer. Take out as many as you like to cook!"
- "If you have some leftover skins, wrap them with a newspaper flyer, then with plastic wrap, and freeze. Transfer them to the refrigerator a day before you want to use them."

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. A lot of it truly is merely using common sense.
