Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family.

When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. Particularly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.
