<i>Before you jump to Christmas Peppermint Bark recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Begin with changing the light bulbs. This will go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Making use of these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Together with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that difficult. It's about being practical, usually.
