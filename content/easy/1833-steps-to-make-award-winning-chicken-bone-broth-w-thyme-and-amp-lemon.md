<i>Before you jump to Chicken bone broth w/ thyme &amp; lemon recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of electricity is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is merely using common sense.
