Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment.

Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. Mostly, all it will take is a little common sense.
