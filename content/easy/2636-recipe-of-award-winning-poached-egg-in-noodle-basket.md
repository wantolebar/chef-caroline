It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
