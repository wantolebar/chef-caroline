<i>Before you jump to Carrot infused chicken ricotta ravioli with baked tomato sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
