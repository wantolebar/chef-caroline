If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Fill your cabinets with healthy foods. This way—even if you choose something a bit greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still selecting foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.
