Start out with exchanging the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them rather than incandescent lights. Although costing a little more originally, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Making use of these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills.
