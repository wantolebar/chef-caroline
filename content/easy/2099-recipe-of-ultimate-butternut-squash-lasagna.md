Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as efficiently as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
