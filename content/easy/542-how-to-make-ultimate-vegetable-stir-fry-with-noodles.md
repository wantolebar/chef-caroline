Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the particular light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you should use them rather than incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than simply exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The family spends considerable time in the cooking area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This likewise occurs in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.
