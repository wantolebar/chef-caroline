- " and 2 tablespoons allpurpose flour"
- " ground ginger"
- " ground cinnamon"
- " baking soda"
- " fine salt"
- " ground cloves"
- " ground black pepper"
- " cayenne pepper"
- " unsalted butter softened"
- " white sugar"
- " finely minced candied ginger"
- " molasses"
- " vanilla extract"
- " large egg beaten"
- " white sugar or as needed for rolling cookies"
recipeinstructions:
- "Whisk flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, cloves, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large mixing bowl"
- "Cream the butter and 2/3 cup sugar together in a separate bowl until smooth, for about 2 minutes. Add the candied ginger, molasses, vanilla, and egg. Whisk until well blended."
- "Add dry ingredients to butter/sugar mixture and mix just until the flour disappears. Cover dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour"
- "Preheat oven to 350F (175C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour 1/2 cup sugar in a small shallow dish for rolling cookies."
- "Form dough into 1 1/2 teaspoon balls, then roll in the sugar before placing on the lined baking sheet."
- "Flatten the cookies to about 1/4 inch thick. (I like to cover the cookie with a small piece of parchment or plastic wrap and then flatten with the bottom of a 1/4 cup measuring cup. The plastic or paper helps keep the cookie from sticking to whatever you use to flatten it). I have also tried rolling out the dough 1/4 inch thick to cut out gingersnap people with a cookie cutter. Dough will soften up if you do this, so rechill as needed."
- "Sprinkle cookies with a pinch of sugar before baking in preheated oven for 10-15 minutes. (Less time for a chewier cookie, more time for a snappier cookie)"
- "Once cookies are cooled, you can decorate with icing if desired, but they really don&#39;t need anything and are delicious on their own!"

<i>Before you jump to Gingersnap Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is finished, most people do not wish to go to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy.

Drink water, not other beverages. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every occasionally isn’t a terrible idea. Using them for your only source of hydration, however, is dumb. When you decide on water over other beverages you are helping your body stay very healthful and hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories out of your diet— without having to resort to terrible tasting diet food. Water is usually one of the keys to really reducing your weight and becoming really healthy.

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Looking to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about reducing your weight. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
