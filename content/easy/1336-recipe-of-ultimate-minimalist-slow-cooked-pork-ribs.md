recipeingredient:
- "2 kg good quality pork ribs iberian free range pork in my case"
- "4 tbsp pork fat"
- "6 clove garlic"
- "1 piece fresh ginger approximately half as much as garlic"
- " black pepper"
- " salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make a paste with the garlic, ginger, salt and pepper. I do it the old way, with pestle and mortar."
- "Don&#39;t cut the meat into individual ribs, it would dry up during the long cooking. Rub the paste on the ribs, cover them well with cling film (or better still put in a Tupper) and leave in the fridge to marinade for at least 12 hours."
- "Preheat oven at 150 °C, 300 F, gas mark 2. Put the meat in a large tray with the pork fat, or some other fat/oil if you don&#39;t have it. Cover the tray with foil and put in the oven. Take it out every 30 min or so to turn it over and bathe with some of the fat and juices from the tray."
- "After 2 hours or so test the meat when you take it out every 30 min. Mine took 3 and a half hours. It should be falling off the bone when you pick it up. For a final touch I put it under the grill at full power for 5 min, uncovered, turning it once so both sides are nicely browned."

That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around.

These kinds of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. It's about being practical, usually.
