<i>Before you jump to cottage cheese &amp; pasta salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as economically as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that hard. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
