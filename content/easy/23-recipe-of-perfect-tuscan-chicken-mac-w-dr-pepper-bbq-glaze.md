<i>Before you jump to Tuscan Chicken Mac w/ Dr Pepper BBQ glaze recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Start out with replacing the bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. You should upgrade your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Obviously this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. It's concerning being sensible, usually.
