It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. A lot of it truly is simply utilizing common sense.
