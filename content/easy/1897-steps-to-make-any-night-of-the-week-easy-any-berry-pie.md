<i>Before you jump to Easy Any-Berry Pie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
