In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks. Add the milk mixture and mix well. Pour the egg-milk mixture into the pan and whisking constantly, simmer for 2-3 mins until the mixture becomes slightly thick. Remove the pan from heat. Add the remaining butter and vanilla, and mix until the butter is melted."
- "Strain the custard through a fine sieve. Keep it aside to cool. Once the custard is cooled, carefully add a spoonful of the custard into the prepared tart crust. Top with fresh fruits of your choice. Enjoy the fruit tarts right away or refrigerate and serve."

<i>Before you jump to Classic Vanilla Custard Fruit Tarts recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Climb stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about losing weight. You want your body to be strong too.
