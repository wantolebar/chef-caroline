<i>Before you jump to Home fries recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Maybe the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
