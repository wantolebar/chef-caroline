<i>Before you jump to Honey Soy Baked Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as effectively as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
