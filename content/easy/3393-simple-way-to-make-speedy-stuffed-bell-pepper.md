<i>Before you jump to Stuffed Bell Pepper recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
