It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that hard. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
