recipeingredient:
- " Yeast"
- " Sugar"
- " Warm Water"
- " Flour"
- " Salt"
- " Oregano"
- " Dried Basil"
- " Olive Oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the yeast, sugar and warm water in a bowl. Stir well to dissolve the yeast and sugar. Let sit for 3-5 minutes to let the yeast bloom (or “wake up”). You&#39;ll see foam on top when it’s awake and ready to go."
- "While you&#39;re waiting for the yeast, combine the flour, basil, oregano and salt in a large bowl. Stir well to evenly distribute the salt. Add the olive oil (it will get sired/mixed in during kneading)."
- "Once the yeast water is foamy on top (see photos below) stir it into the flour mixture. Stir it with a spoon until it forms a loose ball. Turn it out onto a counter and begin to knead the dough. Knead well for 10 minutes. Sprinkle flour on the countertop sparingly as you knead. If you add too much flour the dough will end up dense (more like a bagel) rather than light like a pizza dough."
- "To use the dough the same day, form the kneaded dough into a ball (or cut and form into four small balls for individual pizzas). Spray a bowl with non stick spray, place the dough inside and turn it to coat with oil. Cover the bowl loosely and let it rise in a warm place for one hour. An hour later, after it has risen, punch it down to release some gasses and stretch it into a 16″ round base."
- "Bake in a preheated (completely preheated, no short cuts here) oven at 230°C for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are brown and crispy. Making sure the oven is well heated before hand will ensure that the bottom cooks and gets nice and crispy. If you are going to add toppings, cook the pizza plain for a few minutes before adding the toppings and returning to the oven for the remaining time."

<i>Before you jump to Pizza Dough recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. At the conclusion of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Make smart decisions when shopping for groceries. If you make smart choices when you are buying your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. At the end of your day do you really want to deal with crowded grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You’re going to go home and make what you already have. Your house should be stored with healthy foods and ingredients. This way—even if you decide on something a little greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still choosing foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You need your body to be powerful too.

1. You need  Flour
1. You need  Salt
1. You need  Oregano
1. You need  Dried Basil
1. Get  Olive Oil


##### Instructions to make Pizza Dough:

1. Combine the yeast, sugar and warm water in a bowl. Stir well to dissolve the yeast and sugar. Let sit for 3-5 minutes to let the yeast bloom (or “wake up”). You&#39;ll see foam on top when it’s awake and ready to go.
1. While you&#39;re waiting for the yeast, combine the flour, basil, oregano and salt in a large bowl. Stir well to evenly distribute the salt. Add the olive oil (it will get sired/mixed in during kneading).
1. Once the yeast water is foamy on top (see photos below) stir it into the flour mixture. Stir it with a spoon until it forms a loose ball. Turn it out onto a counter and begin to knead the dough. Knead well for 10 minutes. Sprinkle flour on the countertop sparingly as you knead. If you add too much flour the dough will end up dense (more like a bagel) rather than light like a pizza dough.
1. To use the dough the same day, form the kneaded dough into a ball (or cut and form into four small balls for individual pizzas). Spray a bowl with non stick spray, place the dough inside and turn it to coat with oil. Cover the bowl loosely and let it rise in a warm place for one hour. An hour later, after it has risen, punch it down to release some gasses and stretch it into a 16″ round base.
1. Bake in a preheated (completely preheated, no short cuts here) oven at 230°C for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are brown and crispy.
