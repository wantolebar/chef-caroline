<i>Before you jump to Lemon fruit pie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
