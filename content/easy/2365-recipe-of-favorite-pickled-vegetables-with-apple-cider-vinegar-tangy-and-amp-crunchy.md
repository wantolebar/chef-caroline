It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that tough. A lot of it truly is merely using common sense.
