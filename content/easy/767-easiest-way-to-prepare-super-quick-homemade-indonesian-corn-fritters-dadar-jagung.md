Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way.

That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are a whole lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets.
