recipeingredient:
- "3 large very ripe bananas"
- "2 large eggs"
- "2 tbs granulated sugar"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 tbs unsalted butter  melted"
- "1 cup milk"
- "2 cups allpurpose flour"
- "4 tsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl mash bananas until slightly liquidy. Add eggs, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla. Whisk until thoroughly combined."
- "Add melted butter and stir until just combined, then add milk and stir until well combined with all other wet ingredients."
- "Add flour, baking, powder, and baking soda. Fold into wet ingredients until just combined. You want your batter to be slightly lumpy. Do not over-mix or you&#39;ll have tough pancakes."
- "Let batter rest for 5-10 minutes while you heat a nonstick skillet, iron skillet, or griddle over medium-low heat. When skillet is hot add 1 tsp of butter if desired and let melt (I don&#39;t do this but some people do)."
- "For 6 inch pancakes: Use a 1/3 cup measuring cup to scoop batter out of bowl and pour into hot skillet. Add as many at one time that you can fit without edges touching (my skillet fits one at a time). For &#34;silver dollar&#34; pancakes scoop 2 tbs of batter per pancake into skillet."
- "Cook pancakes on first side until bubbles just begin to come through and edges look slightly dry. Flip and cook 1 minute, or until second side is lightly browned. The trick is to cook pancakes at a low temperature so they cook all the way through without burning."
- "Stack your perfect pancakes on plates and serve with your favorite toppings (I like peanut butter). Can serve 2-8 people depending on how many pancakes you want to give each person. Haha. I was able to get 8, 6 inch pancakes and 2, 4 inch pancakes out of this batch. Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Extra Fluffy Banana Pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Make smart decisions when grocery shopping. Making good decisions when shopping for groceries means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to cope with a busy store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You’re going to go home and use what you already have. Fill your cabinets with wholesome foods. In this way, even when you choose that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't forget that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
