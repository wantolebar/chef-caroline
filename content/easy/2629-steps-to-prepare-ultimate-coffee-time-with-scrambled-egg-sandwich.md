Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as economically as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. It's about being practical, most of the time.
