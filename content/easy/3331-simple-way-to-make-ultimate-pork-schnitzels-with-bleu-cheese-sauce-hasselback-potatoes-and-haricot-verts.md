Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that tough. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
