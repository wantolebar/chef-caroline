<i>Before you jump to Easy Pesto Pasta recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
