- "Essentially I fried my steak for roughly 4 minutes on eat side."
- "Boil water in a nice deep pot, once the water starts boiling lower the heat so that it simmers. Take an egg and put it into a cup."
- "Season your boiling water with salt then take a fork and make a circular motion so that the water in the pot moves in a circle"
- "Take your egg and gently put it into the water as it is moving in a circle (this closes your egg)"
- "Boil the egg for 5 minutes for a lovely runny yolk, 8 minutes for a nice yellow yet firm yolk"
- "Place your food into a plate and chop some parsley then throw it on your egg."

<i>Before you jump to Bacon Asparagus with Steak &amp; Poached Egg recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Start with replacing the lights. Complete this for the entire house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. You also have to obtain the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly discover members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, usually.
