recipeinstructions:
- "● For Your Chicken Broth Start with a quality Rotisserie chicken."
- "Pull all chicken meat from bones and shread. Then refrigerate. Reserve all skin, fat and carcass to the side in a large pot."
- "Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need for your chicken broth. Also, water."
- "Place carcass, skins, fats, chilled broth and water, [enough to cover all ingredients] vegetables and spices in a large pot. Simmer for 5 hours. Longer if you can to create a dense stock."
- "● For your Beef Broth Prepare at the same time as your chicken broth. Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need. Sorry, onion and Oregeno not pictured."
- "Chop your vegetables."
- "Place bone marrow and vegetables on an ungreased cookie sheet. Your marrow will produce copious amounts of oil."
- "Place in oven and roast at 450° for 30 minutes. Check at 15 minutes and stir."
- "Add your seasonings to your beef broth and heat to a simmer."
- "Pull bones and vegetables from oven."
- "Add everything to your broth with enough water to cover ingredients and simmer for 5 hours covered."
- "At the finish, fine strain all solids from your broths and discard. Jar your broth and use them in just about any dish instead of those dishes that call for water."
- "Tips: Heat your oven to 450° first. Then, roast your bones and vegetables. Create your chicken broth second. I&#39;d recommend not using any salt in this dish unless you know exactly what you&#39;re going to do with it. If unsalted - you&#39;ll be able to season as you wish per dish later. Since I typically use mine for Central and South American dishes - I add Maggi Chicken Bullion and Beef Bullion. If you&#39;re interested in the photo attached - it&#39;s my Green Chilie Chicken &amp; Beef Stews that can be found under my profile. Enjoy!"
