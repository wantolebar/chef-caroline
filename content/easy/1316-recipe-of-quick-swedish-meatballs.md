recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, mix together the beef, breadcrumbs, garlic, onion, egg, nutmeg, allspice, salt, pepper and parsley until fully incorporated. Roll the mixture into equal sized balls."
- "In a large, deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the meatballs to the skillet in batches.

Whisk in the Worcestershire, Dijon and seasonings and let this come to a simmer."
- "Let it simmer until it thickens, stirring occasionally, then whisk in the sour cream. Add the meatballs back to the skillet and let them simmer in the sauce for about 10 minutes, until everything is heated through. Serve immediately (We just usually toss it in with egg noodles, then serve)."
