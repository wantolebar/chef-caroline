<i>Before you jump to Easy Thai Red Curry from a Jar recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that tough. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
