<i>Before you jump to Baked Hot Garlic Wings! recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
