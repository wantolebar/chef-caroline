<i>Before you jump to Sambal prawn petai recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as economically as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. It's related to being sensible, most of the time.
