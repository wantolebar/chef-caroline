recipeinstructions:
- "melt butter and mix with milk. make sure the mixture is 30 C, then dissolve yeast in mixture.

- "When risen knead a couple of times only. roll the dough into a rectangle. Size depends on how chunky you want the buns. I usually roll it out till it&#39;s 5-8 mm thick."
- "you&#39;ll want to handle your dough gently from now as it is rising. smooth on a thin layer of margarine, sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon in even layers on top. I generally use more sugar than I think I need as some of it will melt away in the oven. Don&#39;t really measure out this part"
- "roll into a sausage. make sure it&#39;s pretty tightly rolled. cut 1 inch slices. I use my index finger to measure, so about the length of the two first joints ;)"
