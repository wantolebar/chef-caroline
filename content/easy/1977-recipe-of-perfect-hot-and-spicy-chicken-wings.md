<i>Before you jump to Hot and spicy chicken wings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Climb stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. So many people choose the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get wholesome. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also important. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
