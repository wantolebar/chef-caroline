<i>Before you jump to Farewell Parmesan Crusted Chicken w/light Basil, Tomato, Scampi Cream Sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

A massive amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
