Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, nevertheless it will save you money to use it over your oven. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is not true.

Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
