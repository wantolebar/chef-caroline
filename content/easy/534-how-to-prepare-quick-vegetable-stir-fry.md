<i>Before you jump to Vegetable stir fry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not really that tough. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
