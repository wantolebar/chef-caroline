Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it is basically making use of common sense.
