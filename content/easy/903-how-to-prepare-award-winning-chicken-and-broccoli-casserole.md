<i>Before you jump to Chicken and Broccoli Casserole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These kinds of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electricity is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
