- "To preserve in the fridge Transfer your pesto in a tall jar, and level out its surface. Then completely cover the pesto&#39;s surface with a layer of your best olive oil (this will prevent the pesto from oxidizing)."
- "To play with this recipe Increase the amount of basil (four times) and don&#39;t use olives or sun-dried tomatoes for a more classic green pesto. Add chives, ramps (!!), or fresh parsley for variations on herbaceous flavors. Substitute walnuts for cashews for a creamier buttery taste or almonds for a drier fresher take. Take out the fresh tomatoes and double or triple the amount of olive oil for a more traditional Italian version (too heavy on the vegetable fats for me, but deeeeelicious)."

<i>Before you jump to Loaded Pesto Rosso recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. Working out at the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You need to help make your body as strong as possible.
