<i>Before you jump to 13 minute chicken and broccoli recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Start out with changing the bulbs. Do this for the whole house, not just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house as well. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not that tough. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
