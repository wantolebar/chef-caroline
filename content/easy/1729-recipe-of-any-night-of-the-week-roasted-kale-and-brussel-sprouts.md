<i>Before you jump to Roasted Kale and Brussel Sprouts recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Although it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is merely using common sense.
