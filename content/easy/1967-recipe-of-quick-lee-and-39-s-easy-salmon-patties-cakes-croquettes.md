<i>Before you jump to Lee&#39;s Easy Salmon Patties (Cakes Croquettes) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

You may prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
