- "Garnish with parsley leaves and serve."
- "NB: We like our spicy foods really spicy, so I added a green pepper and two red chillies, fried in little oil before I put in the tomato paste and spices. But this isn&#39;t necessary. Next time I&#39;ll edit this to include the sweetener. Hope you enjoy it."

<i>Before you jump to Spicy chicken wings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Consider the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are plenty of things you can do to become healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about slimming down. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
