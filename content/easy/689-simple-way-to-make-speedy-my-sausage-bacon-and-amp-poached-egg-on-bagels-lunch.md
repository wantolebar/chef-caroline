<i>Before you jump to My Sausage, Bacon &amp; Poached Egg on Bagels Lunch ðŸ¥° recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
