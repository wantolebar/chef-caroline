<i>Before you jump to Cottage Pie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Maybe the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. It's about being functional, most of the time.
