recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 200 degrees celsius or 400 fahrenheit.  Wash the potatoes thoroughly.  *I prefer mine with skins on. You can peel the skins off if desired.*"
- "In a sauce pot over medium-high heat, bring 500ml of water to a rolling boil.  Once the water starts to boil, add in salt and baking soda.  Stir to combine well."
- "Add in the potatoes.  Boil until the potatoes are fork tender.  While waiting for the potatoes to be par-cooked, in a skillet over medium-low heat, add oil, garlic, rosemary, togarashi, and mushroom powder."
- "Stir until well combined.  Bring it up to a sizzle.  Once the garlic starts to crisp-brown, remove from heat."
- "Pass the mixture thru&#39; a strainer over a large bowl.  *Do no discard the residue.*  Once the potatoes are cooked to fork tender, drain and transfer onto a working surface.  Using a sharp knife, slice the potatoes in half, but not all the way thru&#39;.  *Careful as the potatoes are still piping hot. Wear a heat proof glove.*"
- "Transfer the potatoes into the bowl of the oil.  Toss to coat the potatoes well.  Transfer everything, including any leftover oil, onto a baking tray.  Season generously with salt and pepper."
- "Give it a final toss to combine well.  Wack into the oven and bake for 15 to 20 mins.  Remove from oven and flip the potatoes.  Return to the oven and bake for another 10 to 15 mins or until the skins start to wrinkle and slightly crispy."
- "Remove from oven and transfer into a large bowl.  Add in the residue from the oil mixture.  Add in nori flakes.  Toss until the potatoes are well coated.  Transfer onto serving plate.  Serve immediately."

<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. It's concerning being sensible, usually.
