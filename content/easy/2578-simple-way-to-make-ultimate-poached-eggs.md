It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
