recipeingredient:
- "3 Tbsp. Butter"
- "1/4 cup flour"
- "1/2 cup milk halfand half OR heavy cream"
- "1 cup cooked chicken minced"
- "1 can (14 oz.) chicken broth"
- "1/4 cup chopped mushrooms"
- "Pinch dried Thyme optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "You can successfully make this soup in less than 10 minutes from pantry items and a couple refrigerated stables... Start by melting 3 tablespoons butter over a medium heat. Once melted sprinkle with 1/4 cup flour and whisk until smooth. This is going to be a roux not a gravy, so take it easy with measuring the flour, no heaping or packing here."
- "Once the flour has absorbed the butter add the milk. Whisk, whisk, whisk. Once the roux thickens add the chicken broth, and you guessed it, whisk."
- "Now because everything else we are adding is cooked and just needs to be brought up to temperature turn the heat to medium-low. Add the minced chicken (this can be canned, rotisserie, leftover, white meat, dark meat, chicken you cooked just because you wanted to make soup... Chicken). Then add the chopped mushrooms. I like using the ugly little canned mushrooms for this soup because it keeps soup prep to less than ten minutes. Stir! You thought I was going to say whisk didn&#39;t you...."
- "I dished my little ones first then added Thyme for my bowl. I hope you enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Cream of Chicken &amp; Mushroom Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Make smart choices when grocery shopping. If you make smart decisions when you are buying your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to deal with a chaotic store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You’re going to go home and make what you have in the cupboards. Make sure that what you have at home is healthful. By doing this, even when you determine that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your lifestyle choices. You really want your body to be strong too.

##### The ingredients needed to prepare Homemade Cream of Chicken &amp; Mushroom Soup:

##### Steps to make Homemade Cream of Chicken &amp; Mushroom Soup:

1. You can successfully make this soup in less than 10 minutes from pantry items and a couple refrigerated stables... Start by melting 3 tablespoons butter over a medium heat.
