<i>Before you jump to Breakfast Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Do this for the whole house, not just the kitchen. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent style, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a little bit more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The kitchen lights in particular will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. A lot of it really is merely making use of common sense.
