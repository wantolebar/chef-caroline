<i>Before you jump to Quick and Easy Doughnuts Made with One Egg and Pancake Mix recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Climb stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are lots of things you can pursue to become healthy. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You really want your body to be strong too.
