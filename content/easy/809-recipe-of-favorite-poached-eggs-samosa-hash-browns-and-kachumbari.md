Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Let's begin with something really easy, changing the actual light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them rather than incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Utilizing these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to obtain the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place.
