- " Steak of your choice I used flank but rib or sirloin work too"
- " white or brown mushrooms"
- " shallot finely chopped"
- " garlic finely chopped"
- " brandy"
- " beef stock"
- " fresh tarragon chopped"
- " heavy cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "The night before, season the steak with salt and place it uncovered in the fridge. This allows the salt time to penetrate the meat, and the cool air dries out the surface of the steak, allowing for a better crust. Take the steak out of the fridge about 20 minutes before cooking."
- "Add a knob of butter and a splash of olive oil to a large pan on high heat. Sear the steak to your liking (I go about 4 minutes per side, depending on thickness). Remove the steak to a plate and tent it loosely with foil to rest."
- "Add the mushrooms to the pan and fry until they release water, about 2 minutes. Let the liquid cook off, then add the shallot and garlic. Fry about 1 minute until fragrant."
- "Add the brandy to the pan. Let the alcohol boil off, then add the beef stock. Simmer until the liquid reduces by about half, about 2 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and stir in the tarragon and cream. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve the mushrooms and sauce on the side, or spoon it onto the steak."

<i>Before you jump to Steak with tarragon mushroom sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not wish to go to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Make smart decisions when shopping for groceries. Making good decisions when buying food means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. Think for a minute: you don't want to go to a busy grocery store or sit in a long line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to get home quickly and have something beneficial. Make sure that what you already have is nutritious. This makes it simple to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Trying to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Don't overlook that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. It is more about making your body as powerful as it can be.
