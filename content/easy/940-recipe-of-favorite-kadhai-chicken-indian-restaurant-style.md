recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1: Brine. Place the chicken in a large bowl add water salt and some vinegar. What this step does is plump the chicken, makes it juicier. Time: Minimum 1 hour. I kept it for almost 3 hours."
- "Step 2: Clean and Gash. Drain the brine chicken and wash it with clean water. Pat dry and put gashes on the chicken. This will help the masla to go deep."
- "Step 3: Marinate. Marinate the chicken with the marinate ingredients above and mix well. Light up the charcoal piece and place it in a dish made out of foil and add ghee to it, immediately covering it. This process is to infuse tandoori flavor."
- "Step 4: Kadhai Masala Mix: Roast the dry whole kadhai spice mix on a low flame. The idea is to roast the spice mix till the aroma of the roasted spices fill up your senses. They should be light brown in colour. Once the mix cools down, ground it coarsely as shown. I used a grinder, you can use the mortar and pestel."
- "Step 5: Cook. Put a thick bottomed large pan on the stove and add the whole spice mix to the pan. After 2 3 minutes of roasting add 2 tbsp of ghee and let the spices sizzle. Once the spices sizzle add 0.5 tbsp of cooking oil(I used rice bran). Add onions."

- "Step 7: Add 1 tsp Ginger garlic paste to the onions. Cook now for 4 -5 minutes. Add turmeric powder now. And 3 slit green chillis."
- "Step 8: Now add tomatoes (200 gms). I used half a tomato can into the pan. Now add salt to taste to the pan and cook really well. The colour should be really intense and dark. It took me 20 minutes of cooking the tomatoes till the oil seperated."
- "Step 8.5: Pre heat the oven at Max. While tomatoes are cooking and are half way through add your marinated chicken to the oven grill. I grilled at Max for 10 minutes."
- "Step 9: Add dry spice and half of kadai chicken spice mix to the tomatoes. Cook for 7-8 minutes and add grilled chicken to it and on high flame mix the chicken and the gravy in the pan. Add the Jus on the grill tray to the pan as well. Cook for 5 - 7 minutes on medium flame and now add cubed onions and capsicum with the remaining kadhai mix masala."
- "Step 10: Cook the chicken for another 15 minutes with cover on pot. You can add water to make it with gravy. I did not because I like my Kadhai chicken with thick gravy. In the end add kastoori methi and 1 tbsp cooking cream. Stop cooking and mix well."
- "Step 11: Serve with chopped coriander."

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise.

Fill your cupboards with wholesome foods. This way, even when you decide that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restrained diets.
