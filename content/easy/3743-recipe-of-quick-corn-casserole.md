It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, after all. A lot of it is merely making use of common sense.
