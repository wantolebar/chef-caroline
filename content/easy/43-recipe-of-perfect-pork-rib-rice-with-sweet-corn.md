<i>Before you jump to 玉米排骨饭 Pork Rib Rice with Sweet Corn recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Begin with exchanging the bulbs. This will go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you must use them in place of incandescent lights. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than simply replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Certainly this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
