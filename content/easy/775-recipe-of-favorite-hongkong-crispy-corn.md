Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and perhaps this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.
