<i>Before you jump to Custard chocolate ball pudding recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle demands. Working out at the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesnâ€™t have to be a chore. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Run the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are plenty of things you can do to become healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You need your body to be powerful too.
