<i>Before you jump to Marinated Korean BBQ Tofu recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Begin with changing the lights. Accomplish this for the entire house, not merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than merely replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that tough. It's related to being sensible, usually.
