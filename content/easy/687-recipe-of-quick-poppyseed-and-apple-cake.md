<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Cash</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
