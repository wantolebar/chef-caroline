<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as effectively as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. A lot of it truly is simply using common sense.
