- "2 lb Green Beans"

- "3 cup water"
recipeinstructions:
- "String and break green beans into one inch or less pieces. Then, clean jars by boiling them to sanitize."
- "Place broken beans into jars and press down and shake while adding to the jars to insure the jars are full as beans will shrink during canning. Be sure to leave at least 1&#34; to 1/2&#34; of space on top of beans."
- "Next add 1 tsp of salt to each jar. Then, fill the jar with water until it reaches the top of the beans but still leaving 1&#34; to 1/2&#34; of space from the top of the jar."
- "Place lids in a pan with water and bring to a boil until lids get hot. When boiling, place one lid on each jar. Then add the rings to each jar. Only place each ring on finger tight."
- "Place jars into a pressure canner. Turn heat to medium and wait approximately 15mins until canning pressure is reached and you have the steam pressure, the top giggles."
- "Allow the cooker to cook at pressure for 20mins. Then, turn off and allow to cool until the canner has no pressure."
- "Remove cans carefully and turn upside down until they cool completely. Tighten rings around each jar. Store in a cool dry place until ready to eat!"
- "They can be stored for years. To eat simply open the jar, pour into a bowl and microwave! :-)"

<i>Before you jump to Canned Green Beans recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not want to go to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Make smart choices when grocery shopping. When you make informed and wise purchases at the grocery store, your meals will get healthier automatically. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with packed grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to go to your apartment and make a little something from your kitchen. Your home should be filled with healthy foods and ingredients. In this way, even when you decide that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. You can do small things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need your body to be powerful too.
