<i>Before you jump to Matzo Broccoli Casserole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a chore. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Go up the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are lots of things you can pursue to become healthy. An costly gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make smart choices every day is a great start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. It is more about making your body as strong as it can be.
