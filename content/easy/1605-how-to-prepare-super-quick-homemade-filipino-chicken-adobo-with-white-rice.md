<i>Before you jump to Filipino Chicken Adobo with White Rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a spot get started on as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. You should change your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than simply replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The family spends a lot of time in the cooking area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Certainly this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, of course. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
