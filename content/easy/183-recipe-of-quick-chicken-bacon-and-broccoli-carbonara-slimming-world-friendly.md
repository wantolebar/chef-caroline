recipeinstructions:
- "Ingredients ready? Let’s go!"
- "First off cut your florets into bite size pieces and put in a frying pan on low heat with 3 sprays of low cal garlic oil. Keep an eye on them as you don’t want them burnt just slightly charred."
- "Whilst your broccoli is gently cooking, remove the sinew from your chicken and slice into small pieces and do the same with your bacon. Put this to the side and check on your broccoli."
- "Your broccoli should now look slightly charred like this and soft but not squishy mush! Now put in your chicken and brown off before adding the bacon and tsb of garlic paste. Cook slowly occasionall tossing (stiring if your clumsy like me)"

- "The pasta should now be done. Before you drain it completely set some of the water the pasta has been cooking In aside. Add the drained pasta to the chicken and bacon mix and mix together. Add a splash of the pasta water and then stir the egg mixture in with the pasta. (I think The idea of the water is that it will stop the egg from scrambling)"
- "Make sure all of the pasta is coated with the sauce and serve! Yum!!"

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as efficiently as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Mostly, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
