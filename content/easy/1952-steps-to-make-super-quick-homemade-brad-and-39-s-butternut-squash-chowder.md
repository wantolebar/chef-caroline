<i>Before you jump to Brad&#39;s butternut squash chowder recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as effectively as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that tough. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
