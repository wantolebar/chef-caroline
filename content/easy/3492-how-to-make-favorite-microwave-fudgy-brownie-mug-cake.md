recipeinstructions:
- "Put your mug on the scale and set the scale to 0. This way you can add your ingredients directly in the mug without getting other pots dirty."
- "In your mug, put the butter and chocolate and then melt in your microwave. Stop it and mix every 30 seconds so the butter wont turn into oil completely. Put the mug on the scale again."
- "Add milk, mixing it in quickly so that the butter won&#39;t harden."
- "Add the rest of the ingredients, one by one. If you&#39;re not using self raising flour, add very little baking powder. Take care, adding too much can make the cake taste weird. Half a teaspoon is too much! Just add a pinch."
- "I can never eat a whole one, so if you want to, you can pour half of the batter in another mug and make two. Put the cake in the microwave and &#34;bake&#34; for 2-3 minutes, taking into account how soft and fudgy you want it to be. Baking it for too long will make it hard and spongy, so make sure it&#39;s still a bit wet on top when you take it out."
- "Add whatever toppings you prefer."

<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as economically as they should. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
