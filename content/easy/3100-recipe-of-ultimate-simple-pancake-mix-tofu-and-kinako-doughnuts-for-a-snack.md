- "They are done."
- "If you have some powdered sugar, I&#39;d recommend sprinkling some on top to make it more delicious. Out of all the recipes that I have made, this version was the best. They are bite sized so you can go to town on them!"
- "If you don&#39;t use an egg, it&#39;s fine. In that situation, use 1-2 tablespoons of milk or soy milk. This also makes it a bit healthier."
