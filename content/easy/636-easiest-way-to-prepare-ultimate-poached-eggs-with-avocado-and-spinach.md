The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
