<i>Before you jump to Chilli Chicken Tagliatelle in Tomato and Sour Cream Sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that difficult. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
