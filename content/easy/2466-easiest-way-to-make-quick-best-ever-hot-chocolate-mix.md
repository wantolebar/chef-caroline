<i>Before you jump to Best Ever Hot Chocolate Mix recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is specifically effective when it's full before a cycle is going. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
