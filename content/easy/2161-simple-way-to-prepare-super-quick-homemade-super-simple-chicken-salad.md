<i>Before you jump to Super Simple Chicken Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle demands. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Run the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people choose the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are lots of things you can pursue to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being smart when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't forget that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. It has more to do with making your body as sturdy as it can be.
