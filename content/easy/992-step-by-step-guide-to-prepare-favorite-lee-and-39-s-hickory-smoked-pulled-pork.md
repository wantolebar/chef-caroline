recipeingredient:
- " 58 lb bone in pork shoulder Butt"
- " Your favorite rub"
- " Prepared yellow mustard"
- " Hickory chips"
- " Apple juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Liberally coat your pork shoulder with your rub and then apply a liberal coat of yellow mustard. Put in refrigerator uncovered for at least 12 hours."
- "Prepare smoker or grill. Soak hickory chips in hot water for at least 30 minutes. I like my smoker to be between 225-250 degrees."
- "Smoke pork shoulder for 2-3 hours with a nice constant smoke. I usually will flip over once. I&#39;m not trying to cook at this point, just smoke."
- "When done smoking put pork shoulder in a large roasting pan. Add enough apple cider to come up around 1/2&#34; along the side of your pan. This will become your sauce. Cover with a lid and cook at 225 degrees. This will take some time. For a 7-8 pound shoulder you can figure around 7 hours. I promise you it is worth your time."

<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, nevertheless it will save you money to use it over your oven. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it will take is a little common sense.
