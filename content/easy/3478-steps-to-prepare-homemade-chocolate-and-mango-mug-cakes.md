<i>Before you jump to Chocolate and Mango Mug cakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Why don't we begin with something quite simple, changing the light bulbs. This will certainly go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. You really need to change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The kitchen lights especially will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
