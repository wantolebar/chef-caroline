Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently.

The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. It's about being practical, more often than not.
