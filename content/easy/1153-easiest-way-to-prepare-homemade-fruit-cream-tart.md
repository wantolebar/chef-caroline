It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many individuals incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. Particularly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle.
