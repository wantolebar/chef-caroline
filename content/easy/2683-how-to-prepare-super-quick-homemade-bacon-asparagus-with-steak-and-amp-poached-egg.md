recipeinstructions:

- "I fried my Steak but you can also grill it, I preheated my pan then added more salt and pepper to my steak."
- "Essentially I fried my steak for roughly 4 minutes on eat side."
- "Boil water in a nice deep pot, once the water starts boiling lower the heat so that it simmers. Take an egg and put it into a cup."
- "Season your boiling water with salt then take a fork and make a circular motion so that the water in the pot moves in a circle"
- "Take your egg and gently put it into the water as it is moving in a circle (this closes your egg)"
- "Boil the egg for 5 minutes for a lovely runny yolk, 8 minutes for a nice yellow yet firm yolk"
- "Place your food into a plate and chop some parsley then throw it on your egg."

<i>Before you jump to Bacon Asparagus with Steak &amp; Poached Egg recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Why don't we begin with something not that hard, changing the particular light bulbs. Do this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than simply exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and discover how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, of course. A lot of it truly is merely making use of common sense.
