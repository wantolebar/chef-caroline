<i>Before you jump to Microwaved lava cake in mug recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

A massive amount of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, after all. Mostly, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
