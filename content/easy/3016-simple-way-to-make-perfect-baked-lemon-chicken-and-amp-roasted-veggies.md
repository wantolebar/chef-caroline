<i>Before you jump to Baked Lemon Chicken &amp; Roasted Veggies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as economically as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, of course. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
