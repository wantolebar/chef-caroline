<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that difficult. A lot of it truly is merely utilizing common sense.
