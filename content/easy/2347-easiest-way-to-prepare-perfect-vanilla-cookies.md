<i>Before you jump to Vanilla cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. Especially if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
