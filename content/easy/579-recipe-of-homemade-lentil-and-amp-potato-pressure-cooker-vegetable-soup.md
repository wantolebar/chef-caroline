<i>Before you jump to Lentil &amp; potato pressure cooker vegetable soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
