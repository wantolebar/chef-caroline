<i>Before you jump to Ken&#39;s Authentic Shakshuka (Poached Eggs in Spicy Tomato Ragout) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
