Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.
