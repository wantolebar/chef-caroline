<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
