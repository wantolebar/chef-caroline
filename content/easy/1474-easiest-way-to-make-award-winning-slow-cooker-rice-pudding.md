Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
