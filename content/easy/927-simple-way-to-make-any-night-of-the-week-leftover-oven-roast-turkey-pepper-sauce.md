Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many men and women wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
