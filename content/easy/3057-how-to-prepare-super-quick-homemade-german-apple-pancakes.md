<i>Before you jump to German Apple Pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, of course. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
