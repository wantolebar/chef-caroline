<i>Before you jump to Low Fat Pasta Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. As soon as you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably easy to live green, all things considered. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
