Although costing a little more initially, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site.

Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.
