recipeingredient:
- " Prime Rib"
- "5 lb Prime Rib bone in"
- "1/4 cup Olive Oil"
- "1/3 cup Minced Garlic"
- "1 tbsp Cracked Black Pepper"
- "1/2 tbsp Dried Onion Powder"
- "1/2 tbsp Dried Rosemary"
- "1/2 tbsp Dried Thyme"
- " Options And Sides"
- " sides Inglehoffers Creamy Horseradish the best brand out there IMHO"
- " sides Creamed Spinach"
- " sides Wedge Salad"
- " sides Fresh Steamed Asparagus"
- " sides Seafood why not make it a surf  turf"
- "2 Packets Au Jus Sauce  2 cups beef broth with sodium  McCormick is a great brand  fresh parsley for garnish"
- " Kitchen Equipment"
- "1 large Disposable Aluminum Roasting Pan"
- "1 large Metal Roasting Rack"
- "1 Quality Meat Thermometer"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring roast to room temperature for at least 2 hours prior to cooking."
- "Rinse roast and daub dry. Place on a metal rack in a roasting pan - fat side up. Leave binding strings in tact."
- "Mix all dry seasonings together in a bowl. Place minced garlic and oil in a separate bowl."
- "● Rinse your roast and pat it completely dry with absorbent paper towels.   ● Coat your roast in your oil and garlic mixture. Use all.   ● Then, pat on your dry seasonings all the way around.    ● Know that no salt is needed in your rub since your Au Jus with beef broth will lend all the sodium you&#39;ll want."
- "● Do not cover roast and cook on a lifted oven rack at 400° for the first 15 minutes. Then, reduce heat to 325° and time for 20 minutes per total pound.   ● This will give you a nice medium rare center and well done ends.   ● Cut time by 3 minutes per pound if you want a very rare center like I do.   ● An ultimate internal temp of 120° stuck in your thickest roast part makes for a perfect rare prime rib in my opinion."
- "● Pull roast from oven and let it rest for 5 + covered for minutes before slicing. This will help its fluids to rise to the surface.   ● Cut binding strings.   ● Slice in between bones and serve as 1 lb slabs per guest.  ● Serve with piping hot Au Jus and chilled Horseradish Sauce."
- "Make your Au Jus but substitute the water called for with beef broth for a more pronounced beef flavor."
- "● Upon serving, I&#39;ll lay the 1 lb slab on a guests serving plate alone. Then, I&#39;ll ladle piping hot Au Jus around the meat. I&#39;ll then garnish individual slabs with fresh parsley.   ● Any other sides - I&#39;ll serve in seperate bowls or on side plates. [i.e., stacked baked potatoes, fresh asparagus, creamed spinach with bread, garlic risotto, or, simple wedge salads]  ● You can also serve this as an impressive Surf &amp; Turf dish. Just add steamed seafood of your choosing to the side. I&#39;ll commonly add King Crab Legs, Jumbo Shrimp or, Jumbo Scallops."
- "● Steam de-thawed crab legs for 5 to 8 minutes in a slight amount of water, lemon juice, pepper corns, a bay leaf and crushed garlic cloves to taste.   ● Serve legs with melted or clarified butter and lemon wedges."
- "● Another great side is baked potatoes.  ● See my recipe for Mike&#39;s Perfect Baked Potatoes."
- "Creamed Spinach. Another great side dish. Quite traditional!"
- "Rare Prime Rib with a dark Au Jus and chilled Horseradish pictured below."

- "Any leftovers can easily make an incredible New Orleans Old Sober, aka, Yakamein Soup. Check that recipe out in my personal recipes under Mike&#39;s Old Sober Soup.

<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s EZ Prime Rib recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the particular light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them rather than incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll usually come across members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. A lot of it is merely making use of common sense.
