This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as effectively as they should.

The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.
