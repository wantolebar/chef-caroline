recipeingredient:
- "2 1/2 cup dry macaroni"
- "12 oz spinach"
- "2 large eggs"
- "2 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese  divided"
- "1 1/2 cup cottage cheese"
- "3/4 cup sour cream"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "12 oz roasted red peppers  drained  diced"
- " black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°F.  Spray a 3 quart casserole dish with non-stick spray."
- "Bring a large pot of water to boil. Salt the water generously and add the macaroni. Cook until the pasta until it&#39;s just barely al dente — a little bit of chew is fine here. Drain and immediately transfer the hot pasta to a large mixing bowl."
- "Add the spinach and toss to combine. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dinner plate and let the spinach wilt in the heat of the pasta for about 10 minutes. Shake the bowl occasionally to mix up the pasta and spinach —some of the spinach may not completely wilt; this is fine."
- "Whisk the eggs until well-combined, then whisk in 2 cups of the cheese, cottage cheese, sour cream, and salt. Pour the egg mixture over the pasta and wilted spinach. Add the diced red peppers and gently stir until combined and all the ingredients are evenly coated with sauce."
- "Transfer the macaroni and cheese to the baking dish. Cover tightly with foil. At this point, the casserole can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours before baking."
- "Bake, covered, for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese over the top of the casserole. Bake, uncovered, for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the cheese has melted and you can hear the casserole bubbling. (If baking straight from the fridge, extend the covered baking time to 45 minutes.)"
- "Let the casserole cool for a few minutes before serving. Leftovers will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to a week."
- "Note: Substitute low-fat (1% or 2%) cottage cheese and sour cream if desired. Non-fat substitutes can also be used, but the casserole will be looser."
- "To freeze: The entire casserole can be frozen, baked or unbaked, but cook the pasta very al dente so it doesn&#39;t get mushy. Warm baked casseroles in the microwave or a low oven until warmed through. Cook unbaked casseroles straight from the freezer for an hour, then uncover, top with cheese, and continue baking until bubbly."

<i>Before you jump to Lighter Macaroni &amp; Cheese recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthful as possible.

Be smart when you do your food shopping. Making good decisions when shopping for food means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. Think for a second: you don't want to go to a stressful grocery store or sit in a long line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You’re going to go home and cook what you have on hand. Your kitchen should be stocked with healthy foods and ingredients. This makes it easy to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start. Trying to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your health levels. You need your body to be powerful too.
