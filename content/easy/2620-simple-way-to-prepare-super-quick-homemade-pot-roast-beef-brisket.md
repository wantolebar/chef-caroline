recipeingredient:
- "700 g wellmarbled beef brisket rolled and tied"
- "1 tsp flaked sea salt plus extra to season"
- " freshly ground black pepper"
- "4-5 tbsp sunflower oil"
- "4 onions"
- "3 sprigs bushy thyme"
- "1 large bay leaf"
- "2 tbsp tomato pure"
- "500 ml hot beef stock made with 1 beef stock cube"
- "200 ml red wine"
- "4 large carrots cut into 3cm114in chunks"
- "6 celery sticks trimmed and cut into 4cm112in lengths"
recipeinstructions:
- "For the beef, season the beef all over with the salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a large flameproof casserole and brown the beef over a fairly high heat for 8-10 minutes, turning every couple of minutes. Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/Gas 3."
- "While the beef is frying, thinly slice two of the onions. Remove the beef from the casserole and put it to one side. Add the onions to the casserole and fry for five minutes or until nicely browned, stirring regularly. Add a little more oil if the onions begin to stick."
- "Stir in the thyme and bay leaf and cook for 20-30 seconds more, stirring. Return the beef to the casserole. Stir the tomato purée into the hot beef stock and pour around the beef. Add the wine and bring to a gentle simmer on the hob."
- "Cover with a lid and place in the oven. Cook for three hours 30min. After about 1hour 45min, take out of the oven and turn the beef. If you press it with a fork, the meat will feel very firm."
- "While the beef is cooking, prepare the vegetables. Cut the remaining onions into half from root to tip and then cut each half into four. Peel the carrots and cut into 3cm/1¼in chunks, trim the celery and cut into 4cm/1½in lengths."
- "Heat another tablespoon of oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Fry the onions for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the carrots and celery and cook for a further five minutes over a medium heat until the onions are softened and all the vegetables are lightly browned, stirring regularly."
- "Remove the beef from the oven and take off the lid. Press the beef with a fork. You should be able to feel it becoming much softer. (If not, return to the oven for a further 30 minutes before adding the vegetables.)"
- "Turn the beef over and nestle all the sautéed vegetables around it. Cover with the lid again and return to the oven for a further 1-2 hours, or until the beef is very tender and yields completely to the pressure of a spoon."
- "To serve the beef, lift the beef out of the casserole with a couple of forks and place on a board or serving platter. Cut off the string and carve into slices. Serve with the poached vegetables, latkes and the rich cooking liquor for gravy."

<i>Before you jump to Pot roast beef brisket recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Start out with replacing the lights. This will certainly go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them rather than incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. You also have to acquire the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and see just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that tough. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
