Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that tough. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
