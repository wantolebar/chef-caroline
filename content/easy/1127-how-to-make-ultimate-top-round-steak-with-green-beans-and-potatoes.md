<i>Before you jump to Top Round Steak with Green Beans and Potatoes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, after all. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
