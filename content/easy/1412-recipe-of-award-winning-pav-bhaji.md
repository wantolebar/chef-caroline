<i>Before you jump to Pav bhaji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
