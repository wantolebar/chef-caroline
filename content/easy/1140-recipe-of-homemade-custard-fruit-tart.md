Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions which might be more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that hard. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
