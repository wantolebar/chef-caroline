<i>Before you jump to Cheese chilli rava pancake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Let us begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Complete this for the whole house, not just the kitchen. You should change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than simply swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in different rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; check out how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
