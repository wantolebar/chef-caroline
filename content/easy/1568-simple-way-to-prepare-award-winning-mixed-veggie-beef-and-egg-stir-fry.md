<i>Before you jump to Mixed Veggie Beef and Egg Stir Fry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as efficiently as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
