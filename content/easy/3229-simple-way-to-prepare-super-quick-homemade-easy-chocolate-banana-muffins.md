<i>Before you jump to Easy Chocolate Banana Muffins recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Begin with exchanging the light bulbs. This will certainly go further than the kitchen, nonetheless that is okay. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent style, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights especially tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house as well. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and discover exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. A lot of it really is basically making use of common sense.
