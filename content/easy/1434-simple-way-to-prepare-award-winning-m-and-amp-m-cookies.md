recipeingredient:
- "2 1/4 cup all purpose flour"
- "1 tsp. baking soda"
- "1 1/2 tsp. cornstarch"
- "1/2 tsp. salt"
- "3/4 cup unsalted butter melted and cooled slightly"
- "3/4 cup brown sugar"
- "1/2 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 large egg at room temperature"
- "1 large egg yolk at room temperature"
- "2 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup MM candies  additional for topping"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cornstarch and salt. Set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together the butter and both sugars until smooth. Then whisk in the egg, egg yolks and vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir until just combined. Then fold in the M&amp;Ms."
- "Cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Towards the end of chill time, preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a couple large baking trays with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Roll the dough into balls, about 1 tbsp of dough per ball and place them on the prepared trays with about 1 inch or so of space between them."
- "Bake for 6-8 minutes. Cookies should still look very soft and underbaked when they&#39;re done, and just starting to brown around the edges, which will result in a soft and chewy cookie once they&#39;ve cooled. Remove from oven and if you&#39;d like, immediately press in a couple M&amp;Ms gently into the tops of the cookies. Let them cool on the baking tray for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. They store at room temperature for about a week."

<i>Before you jump to M&amp;M Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The  is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not wish to go to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Go up the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a fantastic way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. You need to help to make your body as strong you can make it.
