- " Boneless chicken thighs"
- " Flour"
- " Bread Crumbs"
- " Eggs"
- " Salt"
- " Pepper"
- " Paprika"
- " Powdered Garlic"
- " Oregano"
- " Cumin"
- " Olive oil"
- " Bbq sauce I prefer to avoid smokey tasting ones for this"
- " Sweet chilli sauce"
- " Honey"
- " Sesame seeds garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 400°F. Let chicken get to room temp (cooks better if not cold)."
- "Prep 3 bases. Mix flour and dry seasonings in 1 plate (except bread crumbs and sesame seeds). I typically do about 1 tsp of each or to taste. Dry mixture is also up to you, be creative in what you add! In a separate plate, place breadcrumbs. In a 3rd plate, beat eggs. Set these all aside."
- "Pat dry any excess water that may be on the chicken. Cut chicken to 1 inch cubes or less. I prefer removing any fat or skin in this recipe."
- "Mix chicken into flour mix, then egg mix, and finally bread crumb mix and set aside. Between each plate pat off any excess ingredients. This is the most time consuming part, but avoid dumping all the chicken into the flour at once. Doing so makes it difficult to control the amount of ingredients put on each piece. Patience is key! Set chicken on a baking sheet and drizzle with oil."
- "Bake chicken for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes."
- "In a large wok or pan mix sauces and honey on a low heat. It&#39;s up to you to decide the ratio of sauces to control the taste. I love sweet chilli sauce so I tend to add more of that. The amount also depends on the amount of chicken being made."
- "Mix cooked chicken into wok and mix the sauce evenly on the chicken. Garnish if desired and serve."

<i>Before you jump to Baked Sweet Chilli Chicken Nuggets recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
