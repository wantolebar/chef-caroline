<i>Before you jump to Carrot Cake Pie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

You may prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Especially if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
