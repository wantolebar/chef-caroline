<i>Before you jump to Homemade Beef and Broccoli recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
