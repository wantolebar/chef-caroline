<i>Before you jump to My Baked Chicken Drumsticks recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Start out with exchanging the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you should use them in place of incandescent lights. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Obviously this also happens in some other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite straightforward to live green, all things considered. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
