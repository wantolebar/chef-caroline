<i>Before you jump to Brad&#39;s steak roll up&#39;s with heirloom tomato relish recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being practical, more often than not.
