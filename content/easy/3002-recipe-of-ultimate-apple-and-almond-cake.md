- "Cook in the centre of the oven for 1hr 15mins - 1hr 30mins, until a skewer comes out clean, the top is golden and the sides are JUST starting to pull away from the tin."
- "Leave to cool in the tin until just warm, then remove carefully (the sides or base may need to be gently separated from the tin using a knife), dust with icing sugar, and serve with whatever you like. Can be frozen once cooled completely."
