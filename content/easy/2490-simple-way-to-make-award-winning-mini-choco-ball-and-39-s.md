Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
