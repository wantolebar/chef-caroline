recipeingredient:
- " Pot pie"
- "1 sheet puff pastry"
- "1 egg beaten"
- "1 tbsp flour"
- "400 g cooked chicken chunks"
- "7 large mushrooms"
- "50 g peas"
- "3 tbsp white wine"
- "1 tsp English mustard"
- "1 chicken stock cube"
- " Salt"
- " Pepper"
- "1 squeeze tomato paste"
- "1/2 an onion finely duced"
- " Sauted Potatoes"
- "7 large potatoes"
- "3 tbsp butter"
- "1 sprig rosemary"
- "2 cloves garlic"
- " Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Roll out the puff pastry: mark the outline of the pot on the rolled pastry (1/2 cm thick) and cut about a centimetre outwards from the mark you made the with the pot. Flour generously and set aside."
- "Add the mushrooms and onion to a pot and cook until the mushrooms have shrunk. Add in tomato paste, flour, white wine, mustard and the stock cube."
- "Once everything is evenly coated, add in the chopped chicken and top up until everything is submerged with boiling water. This is the filling. You will want to reduce it enough so that it doesn&#39;t make the pastry soggy, but also so it&#39;s not dry."
- "Preheat the oven to 190C."
- "Add in the peas and salt and pepper to taste. Fill up each pot evenly and then place the pastry on top, wrapping it around the sides. Cut a small slit in the top. Brush on the beaten egg as an egg wash."
- "Cook for 30 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, parboil the potatoes for 5 minutes. Strain them once done and place on a chopping board. Salt thoroughly."
- "Cube the potatoes and add into a pan with 1 tbsp of the butter, which should be very hot."
- "Give it a mix a bit to stop burning, and, once it has gotten a bit crispy on all edges, add in the rest of the butter, garlic and rosemary. Baste the potatoes with the hot herby butter."
- "Take the pots out of the oven and place onto a plate. Add the sautéed potatoes and a dollop of mustard. Enjoy!"

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. This will go outside of the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The family spends considerable time in the cooking area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. It's concerning being sensible, usually.
