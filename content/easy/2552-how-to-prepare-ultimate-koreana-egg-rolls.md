recipeingredient:
- "1 pound pork butt"
- "5 oz small size shrimp"
- " Salt sugar pepper"
- "3 TBS oyster sauce"
- "1 1/4 of a medium onion"
- "1 medium and 1 small carrot"
- "2/3 of a green squash"
- "2 small stalks of celery"
- " For dipping sauce"
- "1/2 cup vinegar"
- "1/2 cup sugar"
- "3 TBS ketchup"
- "1/2 TBS salt"
- "1 TBS chili garlic sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut meat and shrimp in small cubes. Sprinkle some salt, pepper and sugar. Mix well. Do not mix shrimp with meat. Their cooking time is different."
- "Cut vegetables the same size as meat."
- "Stir fry meat and shrimp separately. Put in mixing bowl."
- "Stir fry the vegetables. Add salt and pepper. Remove into mixing bowl with shrimp and meat. Cool for a couple of hours in fridge. After 2 hours, add 3 TBS of oyster sauce. Mix well and let it rest for 30 minutes."
- "Put mixture in a colander to strain excessive seasoning. This process will make the egg rolls crispier and will also prevent oil from “splashing” because of seasoning leaking out from rolls."
- "On a sheet of egg roll, with water, use fingers to wet all borders of the sheet, put fillings in middle. Fold up right and left side to cover filling. Then roll the side close to you towards the opposite side to make one egg roll."
- "Use another sheet and wrap a second time (for very thin wrap). I do not use double sheets. When you do so, oil can get in between 2 sheets when frying because the sheets are not sealed. That will make the egg rolls oily."
- "Fry in hot oil (medium heat) for 1mn 40 seconds for each side. Remove on paper towel. Before eating, fry a second time for crunchiness. Medium heat, 2 minutes for each side."
- "For dipping sauce: put all ingredients for sauce in saucepan. Stir and bring to boil on medium heat. Reduce heat to medium low. Simmer to reduce to 2/3."

<i>Before you jump to Koreana Egg Rolls recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy.

Choose water over other refreshments. Sipping a soda or cup of coffee every so often won't hurt you too badly. Using them for your only source of hydration, conversely, is dumb. Choosing water as an alternative to other beverage adds to your body's health and allows it stay hydrated. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Productive weight loss efforts often depend solely on water intake.

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do little things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Don't overlook that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You need to make your body as strong you can make it.
