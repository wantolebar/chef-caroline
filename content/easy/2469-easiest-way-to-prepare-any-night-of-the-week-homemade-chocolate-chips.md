<i>Before you jump to Homemade chocolate chips recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
