<i>Before you jump to Amies Strawberries &amp; Cream Cheesecake Jars recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Run the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
