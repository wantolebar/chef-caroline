recipeingredient:
- " Steak of your choice I used flank but rib or sirloin work too"
- " white or brown mushrooms"
- " shallot finely chopped"
- " garlic finely chopped"
- " brandy"
- " beef stock"
- " fresh tarragon chopped"
- " heavy cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "The night before, season the steak with salt and place it uncovered in the fridge. This allows the salt time to penetrate the meat, and the cool air dries out the surface of the steak, allowing for a better crust. Take the steak out of the fridge about 20 minutes before cooking."
- "Add a knob of butter and a splash of olive oil to a large pan on high heat. Sear the steak to your liking (I go about 4 minutes per side, depending on thickness). Remove the steak to a plate and tent it loosely with foil to rest."
- "Add the mushrooms to the pan and fry until they release water, about 2 minutes. Let the liquid cook off, then add the shallot and garlic. Fry about 1 minute until fragrant."
- "Add the brandy to the pan. Let the alcohol boil off, then add the beef stock. Simmer until the liquid reduces by about half, about 2 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and stir in the tarragon and cream. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve the mushrooms and sauce on the side, or spoon it onto the steak."

<i>Before you jump to Steak with tarragon mushroom sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and perhaps this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water and also steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, of course. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
