<i>Before you jump to Dutch baby pancake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Cash</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
