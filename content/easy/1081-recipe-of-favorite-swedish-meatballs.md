<i>Before you jump to Swedish Meatballs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
