recipeingredient:
- " allpurpose flour"
- " cornstarch"
- " salt"
- " garlic powder"
- " large pack chicken wings and drumettes about 4 dozen pieces"
- " whipping cream"
- " blue cheese"
- " Worcestershire sauce"
- " mayonnaise"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, mix together the flour, cornstarch, salt, garlic powder, and several grinds of black pepper."
- "Pat the wings dry and add them to a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle in a couple of pinches of salt and toss. Use a ladle to scoop in some of the flour mixture, then toss the wings again. Keep going until you run out of flour mixture and all the wings are nicely coated."
- "Shake the excess flour off the wings. Lay them in a single layer on a parchment covered cookie sheet. Put the wings uncovered in the fridge for 30 minutes."
- "Put a large, wide-bottomed frying pan on medium heat and fill it about 3/4 inch with veg oil. If you have a frying thermometer, use it to measure when the oil reaches 350 F. If, like me, you don&#39;t have one, take your best guess as to when the oil&#39;s hot enough."
- "Cook the wings in the oil in batches of 10 to 12 at a time. Flip them after 6 minutes to fry the other side. After about another 6 minutes they should be done. You&#39;ll know they&#39;re cooked when the bubbling of the oil slows down. Lay the cooked wings out on a paper towel lined plate. In between batches of wings, make the blue cheese dip."
- "Add the whipping cream to a small pot on medium-low heat. Once the cream has warmed up, whisk the blue cheese in a small chunk at a time until melted and smooth. Whisk in 4 to 5 dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Take the pot off the heat to cool."
- "When you&#39;re ready to serve, add the mayonnaise to the cooled cheese cream. Add extra salt to taste and stir well to combine"

<i>Before you jump to Crunchy pan-fried chicken wings with blue cheese dip recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some very simple ways to get healthful.

Go up the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. It is more about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
