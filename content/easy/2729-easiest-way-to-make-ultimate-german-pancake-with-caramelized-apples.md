recipeingredient:
- " German Pancake"
- "1 cup all purpose flour"
- "2 tbsp. granulated sugar"
- "1/2 tsp. salt"
- "1/2 cup milk"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "6 large eggs"
- "3 tbsp. unsalted butter"
- " Caramelized Apples"
- "2 tbsp. unsalted butter"
- "2 large granny smith apples peeled cored and sliced thinly"
- "3 tbsp. brown sugar"
- "1 tbsp. granulated sugar"
- "1 tsp. ground cinnamon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 400 F. Grease a 9x13&#34; baking pan lightly and set it aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar and salt. Then add the milk and vanilla. Next, whisk in each egg one at a time, whisking to combine for each one."
- "Place the 3 tbsp. of butter into the prepared pan and place it into the preheated oven for just a couple of minutes, until the butter has melted. Then remove the pan from the oven, pour in the batter right over the butter, and place the pan back in the oven for 17-20 minutes, until it has puffed nicely and the edges are golden brown. Remove it from the oven and let it sit for a few minutes (it will deflate as it sits)."
- "While the German pancake is baking, start preparing the apples. Heat the 2 tbsp. of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the apple slices into a large bowl and toss them in the sugars and cinnamon. Then pour them into the skillet. Cook, stirring around often, for 5-7 minutes, until the apples have softened and the sugars have caramelized slightly."
- "Slice the pancake into 6 equal sized squares and serve with the apple slices atop it."

<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. If you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is not true. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being functional, more often than not.
