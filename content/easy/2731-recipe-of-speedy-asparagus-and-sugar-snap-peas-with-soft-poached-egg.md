<i>Before you jump to ☆Asparagus and Sugar Snap Peas with Soft-Poached Egg recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
