recipeingredient:
- "1 Super Rich Bread Dough"
- "2 Chocolate bars"
- " Topping"
- "1 dash Egg for glazing"
- "5 mm cubes x 12 Butter"
- "1 Granulated sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the bread dough and wait until the 1st proofing is done. The volume will be 1.5-2 times of the original size. It takes a little bit longer than the normal bread dough."
- "Break the chocolate bars into pieces, and divide into 12 portions."
- "When the 1st proofing is finished, divide the dough into 12 portions. Lightly punch down the dough, roll them into balls, and let them rest for about 15 minutes."
- "Lightly pinch the dough with your fingers to release air, and roll out into circles, about 10 cm in diameter, using a rolling pin (make the edges a little bit thinner)."
- "Wrap up a lot of chocolate just like making shumai dumplings."
- "Close the seams completely."
- "Place the seam side down in a cup."
- "Let it proof for at least 30 minutes (I used the bread-rising setting of my oven at 35℃. You can leave it at room temperature during summer for this). Since this dough contains a lot of butter, use lower temperature than usual for proofing."
- "Let the dough rise until it fills 2/3 of the cup."
- "Make cuts with scissors. First, make a deep cut across the center at the half-way point."
- "Secondly, make a cut to the left."
- "Thirdly, make a cut to the right."
- "Brush with egg, then put 5 mm butter cube, and 1/2 teaspoon of granulated sugar into the cuts."
- "Bake in the preheated oven at 180℃ for 13-15 minutes."
- "When you are warming it up, loosely cover with plastic wrap, and microwave for 20 seconds per bread at 500 W. It will be just like freshly baked one."
