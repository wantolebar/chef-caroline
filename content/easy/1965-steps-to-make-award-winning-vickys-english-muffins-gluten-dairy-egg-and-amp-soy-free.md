<i>Before you jump to Vickys English Muffins, Gluten, Dairy, Egg &amp; Soy-Free recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as effectively as they should. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, after all. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
