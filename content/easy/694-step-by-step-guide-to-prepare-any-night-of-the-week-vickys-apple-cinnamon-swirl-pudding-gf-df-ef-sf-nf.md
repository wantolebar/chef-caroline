<i>Before you jump to Vickys Apple Cinnamon Swirl Pudding, GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
