Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows.

Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that hard. It's related to being sensible, usually.
