<i>Before you jump to Dave&#39;s Cream Of Parisian Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is commenced. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
