<i>Before you jump to Chicken Corn Pasta recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as economically as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
