- "Knead together the ground pork, roughly chopped peeled shrimp, finely chopped Chinese chives and all the flavoring ingredients very well until sticky."
- "Divide the dough into 10 pieces. Dust your work surface and rolling pin, and roll out each piece into a circle that&#39;s a bit bigger than a gyoza dumpling skin. Place a portion of the filling in the middle, and wrap the dough around it and pleat the edges to seal them in the middle."

<i>Before you jump to Shrimp and Pork Filled Chinese Chive Dumplings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle demands. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Go up the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over clambering even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Remember: being healthy and balanced isnâ€™t just about losing weight. It is more about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
