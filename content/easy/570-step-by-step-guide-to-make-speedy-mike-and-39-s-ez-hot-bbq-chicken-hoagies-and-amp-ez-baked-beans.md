<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s EZ Hot BBQ Chicken Hoagies &amp; EZ Baked Beans recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Start with changing the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Making use of these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than merely replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights especially are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
