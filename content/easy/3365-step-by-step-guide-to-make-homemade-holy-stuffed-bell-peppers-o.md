<i>Before you jump to Holy Stuffed Bell Peppers O:-) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Consider the stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
