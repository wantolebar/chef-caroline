<i>Before you jump to Spicy garlic salsa recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
