<i>Before you jump to Red Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the end of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Climb stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Trying to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about how much you weigh. It has more to do with making your body as powerful as it can be.
