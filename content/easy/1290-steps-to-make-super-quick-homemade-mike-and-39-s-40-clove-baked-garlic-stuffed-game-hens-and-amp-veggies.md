It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A massive amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's related to being practical, usually.
