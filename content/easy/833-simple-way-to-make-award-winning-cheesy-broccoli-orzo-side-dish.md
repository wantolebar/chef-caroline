<i>Before you jump to Cheesy broccoli orzo side dish recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Maybe the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
