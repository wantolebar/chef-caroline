recipeinstructions:
- "Full disclosure: you can use any peppers or pepper combination you want, green pepper, red pepper, banana, cayenne, habenaro, whatever tickles your tastebuds. This recipe is flexible, just hold to the ratios of overall pepper content to vinegar/sugar/seasoning and create the heat level you like. My banana pepper plants are insane this year thus explaining the following."
- "Start by prepping your peppers. No seeds allowed. You are going to process these in your food processor so don&#39;t worry about chopping."
- "Once every seed has been accounted for, prep your onion by peeling and quartering."
- "Pulse the onion once or twice in food processor and dump ground onion into a 5 quart or bigger pot. Do not process the onion with the peppers or you will have onion water and no one wants that."
- "Process the peppers and dump them in the pot with the onion."
- "At this point I looked at my pepper mixture and found it to have the visual appeal of split pea soup. I hand chopped sweet red peppers to give some bigger red chunks in the visual palette, does nothing to the taste but we kinda eat with our eyes too..."
- "Next add sugar and vinegar."
- "Turn the heat up high and measure in all the seasonings."
- "Bring to a boil and babysit this madness. It foams and bubbles like crazy so do not leave unattended. You may need to remove from heat a couple times to let the foam settle. Once it&#39;s at a boil, reduce to a simmer and let it cook down for 30 minutes."
- "This makes about 12 cups, will keep in the refrigerator for weeks or you can waterbath for longterm storage."

<i>Before you jump to Hot Pepper Relish recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

When you go to the grocery store, be sensible about it. If you make smart choices when you are buying your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. At the end of your day do you really want to deal with packed grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to get home immediately and eat something good. Your house should be stocked with healthy foods and ingredients. By doing this, even when you decide that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are a whole lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins.
