Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite easy to live green, of course. It's about being functional, most of the time.
