<i>Before you jump to Vanilla Chocolate Chip Pudding Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Perhaps the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Especially if you ensure that the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
