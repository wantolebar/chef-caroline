<i>Before you jump to Super moist chocolate cake, (tried and tasted and loved)
@mubina_18 recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Probably the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's related to being practical, usually.
