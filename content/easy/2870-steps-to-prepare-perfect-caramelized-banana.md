It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less frequently, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
