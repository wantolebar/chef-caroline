Start out with changing the bulbs. This will probably go further than the kitchen, nonetheless that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Utilizing these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there.

Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.
