It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
