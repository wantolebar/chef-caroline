Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money.

In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong.
