- " whole duck"
- " nutmeg"
- " orange"
- " dried sage"

- " whole milk"
- " butter"
- " onion peeled and cut in half"
- " cloves"
- " bayleaf"
- " white breadcrumbs"
- " double cream optional"
- " salt and white and black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "The duck and the cabbage take about the same amount of time, and after the first 20 minutes can cook in the same oven. They can also sit a while after being cooked, giving you time to make any accompanying vegetables (like duck-fat roasted potatoes and parsnips) and the bread sauce. So get organised before you begin cooking and prep in advance. Grate the orange zest and nutmeg and mix with a couple of teaspoons of dried sage. Preheat the oven to  220°C/Gas 7."
- "I had some leftover mashed potato from the day before, and a classic stuffing for roast duck is potato-based, so I thought I&#39;d try it out, but it&#39;s completely optional. I mixed it with some dried sage and white pepper and pushed it into the duck&#39;s cavity, together with a peeled onion (also optional)."
- "Rub a little olive oil over the duck and then sprinkle the nutmeg, orange and sage mixture over the top. Add lots of black pepper and salt. Place in the preheated oven."
- "Now put together the braised cabbage, if you&#39;re going to be around you can cook it on the stove top, or cook with the duck once the oven has been turned down. Prepare the cabbage, onion, apples and garlic, and in a small bowl mix together the nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and brown sugar, together with some salt."
- "Layer a third of the cabbage in the pan or casserole, add a third of the onions, apple, garlic and sugar and spice mixture."
- "Repeat the layers until everything is used up, then pour in the wine vinegar (red or white). Dot the top with butter and cover with a tight fitting lid."
- "After 20 minutes in the oven at the high heat the duck will need to have some of the fat drained off into a heatproof bowl. Keep this for roast potatoes. Return the duck to the oven and cook on for another 10 minutes, then drain off the fat again if necessary. You can then add a glass of dry vermouth or white wine, or water if you want to, this stops the roasting pan burning and helps the meat juices collect for gravy."
- "Return the duck to the oven and reduce the heat to 180°C/Gas 4. Add the cabbage if you&#39;re cooking in the oven, or place the pan on a low heat on the stove top. In a small pan infuse the milk for the bread sauce together with the butter, onion, cloves, bayleaf and black and white pepper. Bring slowly to a simmer, then cover and remove from the heat."
- "Go for a walk for an hour and a half."
- "When the duck is golden and crispy, and the flesh on the thigh is tender when you pinch it, it&#39;s done. It can now sit and rest while you prepare your vegetables, and finish the bread sauce. Drain the milk into a clean pan and discard the onion and flavourings. Add the breadcrumbs to the milk and cook over a low heat, stirring from time to time, for 4–5 minutes, then cover and set aside."
- "Add the redcurrant or cranberry sauce to the red cabbage and check the seasoning. Make gravy with the meat juices if you wish. Stir in the cream to the bread sauce, transfer to a bowl and add a knob of butter. Serve the duck with the cabbage and bread sauce and vegetables."

<i>Before you jump to Roast Duck with Braised Red Cabbage and Bread Sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as economically as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less frequently, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being sensible, usually.
