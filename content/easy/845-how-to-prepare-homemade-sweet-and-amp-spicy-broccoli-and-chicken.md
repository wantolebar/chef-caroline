<i>Before you jump to Sweet &amp; Spicy broccoli and chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

The kitchen alone offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. It's related to being functional, usually.
