<i>Before you jump to Chicken Alfredo in a garlic parm &amp; herb bread bowl recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

You may well prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
