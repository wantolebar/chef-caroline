<i>Before you jump to Chewy Gingerbread Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesnâ€™t have to be irritating. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Go up the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will decide to be lazy and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. Itâ€™s about making your body as sturdy as it can be.
