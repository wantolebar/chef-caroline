<i>Before you jump to Spaghetti vegetarian Seitan Bolognese recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Begin with replacing the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you should use them in place of incandescent lights. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular are often left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house as well. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. Typically, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
