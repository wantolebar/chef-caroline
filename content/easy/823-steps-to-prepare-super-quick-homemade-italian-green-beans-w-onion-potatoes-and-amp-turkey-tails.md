Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.
