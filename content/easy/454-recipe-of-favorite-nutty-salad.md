<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as efficiently as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that happen to be more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less frequently, will also save electricity.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that tough. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
