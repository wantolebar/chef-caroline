If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors earlier and walk the rest of the way?
