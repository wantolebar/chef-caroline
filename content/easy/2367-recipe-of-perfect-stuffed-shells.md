<i>Before you jump to stuffed shells recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a place to begin with as any. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you will need to use them rather than incandescent lights. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. It goes further than merely swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular will often be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
