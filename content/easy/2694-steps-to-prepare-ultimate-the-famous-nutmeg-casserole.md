Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is as good a spot to begin with as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a little bit more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The family spends major time in the kitchen area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house also. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, all things considered. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
