Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many men and women mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
