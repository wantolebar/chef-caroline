The normal light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Utilizing these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills.

Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.
