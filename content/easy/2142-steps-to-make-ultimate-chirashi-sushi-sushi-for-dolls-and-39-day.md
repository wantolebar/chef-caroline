<i>Before you jump to Chirashi Sushi (Sushi for Dolls&#39; Day) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Start with replacing the bulbs. Do this for the entire house, not only the kitchen. You really need to upgrade your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house also. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it is basically utilizing common sense.
