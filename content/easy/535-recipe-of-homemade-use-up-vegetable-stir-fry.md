<i>Before you jump to Use-up Vegetable Stir-fry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as efficiently as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to operate as often.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
