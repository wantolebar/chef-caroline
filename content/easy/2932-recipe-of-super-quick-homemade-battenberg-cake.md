recipeingredient:
- "450 g marzipan"
- "175 g butter"
- "175 g caster sugar"
- "175 g selfraising flour or plain flour  1 tsp baking powder"
- "3 eggs"
- "2-3 tsp apricot glaze or sieved apricot jam"
- "1 tsp vanilla essence"
- " Red or pink food colouring Icing sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cream together the butter and sugar. Whisk the eggs in a small bowl together with the vanilla essence. Add half the eggs to the butter and sugar and beat in."
- "Sieve in half the flour and beat well. Now beat in, consecutively, the remaining egg and flour.  Lightly grease and line an 8″ (20 cm) square cake tin with baking paper. Make a divider from baking foil and place down the centre of the tin. Pour one half of the mixture into one half of the cake tin."
- "Beat in enough food colouring into the remaining mixture to give a strong pink colour, then pour it into the other half of the cake tin. Bake at 170°C for 25-30 minutes and allow to cool before turning the cake out of the tin."
- "Carefully trim the two sponge cakes to given neat rectangles of cake. Cut each sponge down the centre to give a total of four long oblongs. Using warm apricot glaze, stick the oblongs together into a checkerboard pattern. Trim further if necessary."
- "Sprinkle icing sugar onto a flat surface and roll out the marzipan to around 5 mm (¼”) thick. Spread apricot glaze onto the marzipan and slide the cake into the middle of the marzipan. Fold up the sides and make a neat seam on the top of the cake."
- "Turn the cake over so that the seam is on the bottom and trim the ends of the cake. Place on a serving plate/board and dust with icing sugar."
- "#Tips   You can make apricot glaze by melting apricot jam in a pan and passing it through a sieve. In fact any jam will do as long as it doesn’t have bits in it – what the Americans call “Jelly”.   I find that gel or paste food colourings keep their colour much better during baking than liquid food colourings. You can usually buy them online and because you need so little for a strong colour they last for ages."
- "If your cake sticks to the flat surface, carefully run a palette knife under the length of the cake.   Don’t throw the off-cuts of cake or marzipan away – eat the cake and keep the marzipan for another recipe!"

<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as effectively as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
