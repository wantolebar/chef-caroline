recipeingredient:
- "200 grams  Ground chicken"
- "100 grams  Ground pork or you can use ground chicken only  or combine in the ratio you like"
- "1/2  Onion or the white part of a Japanese leek"
- "50 grams  Tofu not drained"
- "1 tbsp  Sake"
- "1  1 to 2 teaspoon  Oyster sauce"
- "1 tsp  Katakuriko"
- "1 dash  Salt and pepper"
- "1 bag Shumai skins"
- "1 Lettuce"
- "1 Boiling water"
- "1 Soy sauce"
- "1 Japanese mustard or rayu"
recipeinstructions:
- "Finely chop the onion."
- "Cut the shumai wrappers in half to end up with rectangles. Julienne the wrappers finely, cutting them on the short side of the rectangles about 2-3 mm thick."
- "Put the ◎ ingredients in a bowl and mix well with your hands until the mixture is sticky."
- "Line a frying pan with a piece of kitchen parchment paper that&#39;s been cut to be a bit bigger than the bottom of the pan. Rip up some lettuce leaves and put them on top of the paper."
- "Form the Step 3 mixture into shumai-sized portions, and line them up on top of the lettuce from Step 4. You don&#39;t have to roll them into balls; if they&#39;re sort of ball-shaped that&#39;s fine."
- "Sprinkle the Step 2 julienned wrappers on top of the meat balls."
- "Pour the boiling water on the outside of the kitchen parchment paper (to go on the bottom of the pan) using a cup or something. Cover the pan with a lid, tucking all the paper under it so it&#39;s not sticking outside the pan, and start heating it."
- "When the water comes to a boil, turn the heat down to medium-low and steam for 4 to 5 minutes. When the water has boiled off, take the lid off. If the wrapper dough has turned translucent, the shumai are done!"
- "Tilt the frying pan with one hand, pick up the kitchen parchment paper with the other, and slice the shumai, paper and all, onto a plate."
- "If you weren&#39;t able to steam all the shumai, steam the remaining ones following Steps 4 through 9. Using a 26 cm frying pan, it takes 2-3 batches to cook up 40 to 50 shumai."
- "Serve with the lettuce and your favorite condiments. I served with black pepper, Japanese mustard and soy sauce."
- "The more ground pork you add to the filling (see photo), the more assertively flavored and hearty the shumai will be. If you only use ground chicken they&#39;ll be lighter and easier to eat."
- "I know there are lots of steps, but if you&#39;re fast, you can make these in 15 minutes. They&#39;re really easy to make."
- "Key point 1: Cut the shumai wrappers as thinly as possible to make the shumai look pretty when done."
- "Key point 2: If you add some tofu to the filling, the shumai will be fluffy and healthier. They&#39;ll also be less likely to become hard when cold."
- "Key point 3: There&#39;s no need to have a steamer ready. You don&#39;t need to wait for the water to boil either.  It&#39;s such a time-saver!"
- "Key point 4: If you line a frying pan with kitchen parchment paper and pour boiling water under the paper, it functions like a steamer."
- "Key point 5: In addtion, by just moving the paper you can transfer the shumai easily to a plate, ready to serve! Add the delicious steaming liquid to the plate too."
- "Key point 6: The lettuce lined underneath the shumai retains the delicious meat juices! The lettuce absorbs the delicious flavor and nutrition of the meat too."
- "Key point 7: Since no oil is used, not only is this quite healthy, the frying pan barely gets messy, so cleanup is a breeze."
