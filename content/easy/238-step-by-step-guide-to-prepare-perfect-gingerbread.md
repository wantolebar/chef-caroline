<i>Before you jump to Gingerbread recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise.

This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs.
