Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as effectively as they should.
