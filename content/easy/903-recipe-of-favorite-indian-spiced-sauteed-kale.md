<i>Before you jump to Indian spiced sauteed kale recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A massive amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
