recipeingredient:
- " Marzipan"
- "55 g ground almonds"
- "1 tbsp maple syrup"
- "1/4 tsp almond extract"
- " Chocolate ganache"
- "115 g 70 dark chocolate"
- "2 tbsp coconut oil"
- "2 tbsp coconut cream"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt the chocolate, coconut oil, coconut cream and vanilla extract very gently in a heavy bottomed saucepan. Once all of the ingredients are molten and well combined, pour the ganache into a bowl or Tupperware container and put in the fridge to cool."
- "Add your almond flour, maple syrup and almond extract to a medium sized mixing bowl. Stir with a metal spoon to mix the ingredients well and start bringing the mixture together."
- "Using your hands, continue to bring together the marzipan mixture into a ball. After a few minutes, the loose breadcrumb-like texture should start to stick together to form a moist but crumbly dough. Keep kneading until the dough forms a tightly packed ball of marzipan."
- "Roll the dough out with your hands to form a thick sausage. Using a knife, divide the mixture into 10 evenly sized pieces."
- "Using the palms of your hands, roll each piece into a ball."
- "Take your chocolate ganache out of the fridge, you want it to be a thick, glossy consistency. Spear a marzipan ball on a skewer and coat it evenly in chocolate. If you don’t have a skewer you can use 2 teaspoons to roll the marzipan in the chocolate. Set the covered marzipan down on a sheet of greaseproof paper. Repeat the process until all of the balls are coated."
- "The first truffle you coated should be starting to set, repeat the whole process until each truffle has 2 coats of chocolate ganache. Then leave for 30 minutes to harden."
- "Roll each truffle in cocoa powder and enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Easter Marzipan Truffles recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Take the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done every single day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the selections you make each day is a start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also important. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your health levels. You really want your body to be strong too.
