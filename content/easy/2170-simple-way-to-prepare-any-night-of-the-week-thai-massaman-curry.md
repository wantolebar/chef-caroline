<i>Before you jump to Thai Massaman Curry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being functional, most of the time.
