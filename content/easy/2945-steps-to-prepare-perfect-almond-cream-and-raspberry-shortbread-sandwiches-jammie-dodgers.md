recipeingredient:
- "110 g unsalted butter softened"
- "55 g caster sugar plus extra to sprinkle"
- "165 g plain flour plus extra for dusting"
- " For the almond cream"
- "250 g marzipan"
- "125 g butter softened"
- "100 g seedless raspberry jam"
recipeinstructions:
- "For the almond cream filling, grate the marzipan into a food processor, then add the butter with a pinch of salt. Whizz until quite smooth, combined and pale. Transfer to a bowl, cover with cling film and chill for 1-2 hours until firm."
- "For the shortbread whizz together the butter and sugar until fluffy (quite tricky with such minute amounts), add the flour (I used 150g flour and 15g ground rice by the way, adds crunch to cookies) and pulse until just forming a dough. Preheat the oven to 150°C/Gas 3½."
- "Roll the dough out very thinly, cut in rounds with a biscuit cutter and transfer to a baking sheet lined with baking parchment. The recipe says cut into 30 rounds, but there&#39;s nowhere near enough dough for that! I got 14."
- "Use a piping bag nozzle or similar little round shape to cut holes in the middle of half the biscuit rounds. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes until crisp and golden. Cool completely on a wire tray."
- "When the cookies are cold spread about a teaspoon of almond cream on a bottom half and make a little indent in the middle. Add about half a teaspoon of jam."
- "Add a top half and press down gently so that the jam comes up slightly through the hole. Dust with icing sugar and then decide who is going to get one of the 7 cookies, unless you&#39;ve doubled up!"

<i>Before you jump to Almond Cream and Raspberry Shortbread Sandwiches (Jammie Dodgers) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Go up the stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about slimming down. You really want your body to be powerful too.
