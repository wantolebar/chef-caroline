<i>Before you jump to Dum  Chicken Biriyani recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good an area to begin with as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. You need to replace your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more initially, these bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Along with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The family spends considerable time in the cooking area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Obviously this also happens in some other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably easy to live green, after all. It's about being practical, usually.
