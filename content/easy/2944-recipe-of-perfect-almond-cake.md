<i>Before you jump to Almond Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
