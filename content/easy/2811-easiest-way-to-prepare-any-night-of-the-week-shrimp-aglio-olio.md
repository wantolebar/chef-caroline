<i>Before you jump to Shrimp Aglio Olio recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
