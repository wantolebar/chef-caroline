<i>Before you jump to Vegetable bath recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as economically as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that tough. It's about being sensible, more often than not.
