Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many individuals incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is basically making use of common sense.
