<i>Before you jump to Butter chicken (indian Style) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy and balanced.

Drink water, not alternative beverages. Soda and coffee, when consumed in small amounts, aren't that bad. Using them for your sole source of hydration, however, is dumb. When you decide on water more than other beverages you are helping your body remain very healthful and hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories out of your diet— without having to be forced to eat terrible tasting diet food. Successful weight loss efforts often depend solely on water ingestion.

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy and balanced. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also important. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You need to make your body as strong you can make it.
