recipeingredient:
- " Sponge Cake"
- "60 grams Pancake mix"
- "4 Eggs"
- "50 grams Granulated sugar caster sugar"
- "200 ml Double cream 15x if you plan to cover the cake or put a lot of cream inside"
- "30 grams Granulated sugar caster sugar"
- "1/2 stick Vanilla beans essence"
- "1 Rum or grand mariner optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 400°F/200℃. Line a baking tray with parchment paper, and sift the pancake mix ."
- "Prepare a dry clean bowl and a hand mixer. Put the eggs and sugar into the bowl and whip for about 10 minutes until the mixture turns white."
- "When the batter becomes heavier like ribbons, add pancake mix in several batches, stirring lightly until all the flour has been absorbed."
- "※The dough will be rough if you don&#39;t mix well enough, but it will become too fine if you mix too much. ★Stir the dough throughly from the bottom until it becomes shiny as shown in this picture♡."
- "When it&#39;s mixed throughly, pour the batter into the baking tray and spread it out evenly with a scraper. Drop the tray slightly onto a kitchen surface to remove air bubbles and bake in the oven for 10 minutes."
- "Take out the baking tray after 10 minutes, and gently press the cake. If you hear a fizzing sound, it&#39;s not done yet. Bake for a few more minutes."
- "When it&#39;s done, cover with cling film so that it stays moist and let it cool down a little. For a light colored swiss roll, cover the browned side with cling film."
- "Add granulated sugar to the double cream. Cut the vanilla bean into half, scrape the insides, add to the cream and whip. (You could use vanilla essence instead.)"
- "If you want to make a swiss roll, whip the cream until soft peaks form. If you want to make a log cake (as shown in the main photo), whip the cream until stiff peaks form. Keep watching the cream as dairy-based heavy creams stiffen quickly."
- "You can choose to roll the brown side inside or outside. If you want to remove the brown color, peel off the cling film gently and the brown bit will come off as well. Slice off the edge at the far end diagonally."
- "Put parchment paper under the sponge cake, spread more cream on the front half. (If you want to add some fruit, do it here.)"
- "When you have rolled the whole thing up (I rolled the browned side out), cut both ends and it&#39;s done. You can cut it nicely if you chill the cake and cut it gently with a warm knife."
- "Enjoy decorating the cake as you like ."

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a spot to start as any. This will go beyond the kitchen, nonetheless that is okay. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more in the beginning, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Together with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that hard. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
