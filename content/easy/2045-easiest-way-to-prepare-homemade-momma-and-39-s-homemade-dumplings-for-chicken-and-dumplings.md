<i>Before you jump to Momma&#39;s Homemade Dumplings for CHICKEN and DUMPLINGS recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

Climb stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about losing weight. You need your body to be strong too.
