<i>Before you jump to Tabbouleh recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Start with changing the bulbs. Accomplish this for your house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. You also have to get the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The kitchen lights specifically will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house as well. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. A lot of it is basically making use of common sense.
