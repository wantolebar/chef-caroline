Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

You may possibly prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that tough. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
