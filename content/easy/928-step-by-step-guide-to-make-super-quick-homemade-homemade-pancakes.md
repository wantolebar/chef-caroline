<i>Before you jump to homemade pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Do this for the whole house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you will need to use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more initially, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. Along with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house as well. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
