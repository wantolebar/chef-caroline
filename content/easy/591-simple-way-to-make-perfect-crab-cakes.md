<i>Before you jump to Crab cakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the conclusion of the day, almost everyone want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a chore. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Take the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing down and up it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done each day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about slimming down. It is more about making your body as powerful as it can be.
