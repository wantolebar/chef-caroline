<i>Before you jump to Vegetable Lasagna recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as economically as they should. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that tough. A lot of it truly is merely using common sense.
