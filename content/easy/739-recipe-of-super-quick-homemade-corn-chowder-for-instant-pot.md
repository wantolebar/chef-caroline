Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet.

Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, after all. It's about being practical, most of the time.
