recipeingredient:
- "1/2 cup mayonnaise I used Kraft mayonnaise with olive oil"
- "1/4 cup to 12 cup Ranch dressing depending on your taste I used Wishbone"
- "1 cup to 1 12 cups bow tie pasta"
- "1/4 cup finely shredded carrot"
- " salt"
- " lemon pepper seasoning"
- " Fresh lime juice"
- "2 piece chicken breasts I had small but if you use a large one 1 should be fine"
- " Bacon pieces"
- "1 cup corn"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring a pot of water to boil. Add salt to water to taste. Once boiling add chicken breasts. Boil until cooked through."
- "When cooked thoroughly remove from water and let sit for 5-10 to cool. To the same water add the pasta, asking more water if needed.  You do not need to add more salt because the water is already salted."
- "While pasta is cooking cut or shred chicken to desired size. Squeeze the fresh lime juice onto the chicken, making sure to combine it well, while it&#39;s still warm so that it may soak up the flavor."
- "After cutting the chicken, grate the carrot in a bowl and add the mayonnaise and ranch dressing letting it sit for a couple of minutes."

- "If you are using frozen corn, as I did, add it tonthe water that you cooked the chicken and pasta in. Cook until heated through usually about 3 min. If you are using can corn you can skip this step."
- "While the corn is heating up, add the drained pasta to the mayonnaise mixture along with the chicken and lemon pepper. When the corn is done, either run it under cold water as to cool it down, or add to the pasta mixture as is."
- "Mix all of the ingredients until combined well. Then lastly add in the bacon pieces and mix well. You can eat as in or place in the fridge to serve cold."

<i>Before you jump to Easy and simple homemade pasta salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Go up the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. Even just a sole flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get wholesome. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done every single day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your lifestyle choices. You need to help to make your body as strong it can be.
