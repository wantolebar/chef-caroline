<i>Before you jump to Crispy Chicken Hashbrown Bake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. You need to upgrade your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more initially, these bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. Making use of these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights especially will often be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house also. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that tough. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
