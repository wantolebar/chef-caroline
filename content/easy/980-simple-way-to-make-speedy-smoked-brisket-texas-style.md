recipeingredient:
- " beef brisket"
- " crushed black pepper"
- " sea salt"
- " squeezy yellow mustard eg Frenchs"
recipeinstructions:
- "Trim the brisket of excess fat and sinew. It&#39;s best to use your own judgement, but you can find instruction online. Mix your rub, you can adjust to your own taste, my preference is above."
- "Squeeze a small amount of mustard on to either side of the brisket, then add your rub - the mustard should be a very thin layer, just to enable the rub to adhere and the rub should be an even coating."
- "Wrap in cling film and chill. Then prepare your cooking method. For an oven - heat to 150째C and towards the end allow the meat to come up to room temperature. For a BBQ/smoker - light your fire and wait until the smoke burns clear."
- "When your cooker is ready, place the meat inside and leave. For an oven; it&#39;s best placed over a pan of stock, covered in foil and left for five hours. On a BBQ/smoker it will depend on the size of your brisket - for a 5kg joint, I would say maximum two hours in the smoke, then wrap in foil and leave maintaining the heat. It will be done when the temperature internally is around 90째C."
- "If oven-cooked, wrap in foil and allow to rest till cool enough to slice/shred. If BBQ&#39;d/smoked, allow to cool for 1/2 hour then slice. Serve as you see fit."

<i>Before you jump to Smoked Brisket Texas style recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good an area to begin with as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. You need to replace your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a small amount more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than merely exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and discover how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that hard. It's about being sensible, usually.
