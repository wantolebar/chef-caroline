recipeingredient:
- "450 g bread flour 13 cup of sugar Pinch of salt"
- "2 teaspoons dried instant yeast 1 cup of warm milk"
- "2 egg yolks keep the egg whites 30 g soft unsalted butter"
- "1 tablespoon sunflower oil Plastic wraps"
- "1 little bit of flour to put on your countertop when needed"
- " Baking paper Nutella White sesame seeds"
- "1 little extra sugar and extra milk"
- " Large bowl and different kitchen utensils"
recipeinstructions:
- "1. Put the flour into the big bowl together with the sugar, salt and the yeast. Give a little mix to the ingredients.  2. Add the warm milk to the dry ingredients (if it is warm will help activate the yeast) together with the egg yolks and the soft butter."
- "3. Start binding the ingredients together with a fork then use your hands. You will need to have a slightly sticky dough.  4. Put the dough on your counter and start working it for about 10 minutes and the stickiness will go away. If it gets too dry, just stick your hands into some warm milk and get back to working it with it."
- "5. Your dough now should be nice and elastic. Take your bowl back, put the oil in it and just cover your dough with it, then seal with a plastic wrap.  6. Pop the bowl somewhere warm and let it grow for 1 hour.  7. Remove the dough from the bowl and cut it into 4 even pieces."
- "8. Sprinkle some flour on your countertop and take one of the 4 doughs. Start teasing it and you will want to make a slightly square bottom, more like a triangle shape. It should start looking like a Christmas tree. Stretch it until it is fairly thin, the size of tree depends on you.  9. Put the dough on a piece of baking paper."
- "10. Take one cup of nutella and spread it out across the surface of the bread, but not all the way down, leave a little bit of surface free and there you will make the trunk of the bread (add nutella there). Don’t put the nutella too thick, it will be a mess!  11. Repeat the process of dough shaping and nutella spreading for all of your remaining doughs. Put each dough over the other when finished, then spread the nutella, but not on the last dough!"
- "12. After your doughs are ready and in place, cut out a straight line with the edges, and then you will cut out the trunk area.  13. Make two imaginary lines starting from the trunk area, going up to the top, then start cutting stripes horizontally (they should be about one inch thick) on both sides.  14. Start twisting the sides as you can see in the pictures."
- "15. When you finished doing your twists, get the bread with the baking paper on a baking pan and then cover it with a damp cloth for half an hour, 40 minutes.  16. Preheat oven for 180 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit) and mix the remaining egg whites with a little warm milk.  17. Brush it over the tree and put it into the oven for about 15 minute until golden brown."
- "18. Take the bread out and brush some sugar with water over it so it will have a nice glow.  19. Sprinkle the some white sesame seeds and your tree is ready!  ENJOY!☺"

<i>Before you jump to 🎄🎉❄☃🎉🎄❄☃
🍞Christmas Tree Nutella Bread🍞 recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Make smart decisions when shopping for groceries. When you make wise choices at the grocery store, your meals will get much healthier automatically. Think for a minute: you don't want to go to a busy grocery store or sit in a long line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to get home immediately and eat something great. Fill your cupboards with healthy foods. In this way, even when you choose that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are a whole lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
