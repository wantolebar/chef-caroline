Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Begin with changing the lights. Do this for your house, not just the kitchen. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent style, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Making use of these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Coupled with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house as well. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's about being practical, usually.
