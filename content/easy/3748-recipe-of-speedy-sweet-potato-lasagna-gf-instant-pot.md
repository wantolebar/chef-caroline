recipeingredient:
- "1 large sweet potato"
- "2 cups ricotta or cottage cheese"
- "1/2 cup your favorite pasta sauce"
- "1 cup spinach or some other yummy veg"
- " Olive oil optional"
- " Shredded cheese Italian blend or mozzarella"
- " Spices see step 2 for details"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel sweet potato and use a mandolin to (carefully!) slice sweet potato into thin slices. (Hint: search for &#34;slice-proof&#34; kitchen gloves; you can find them for as low as $10 and they&#39;ll keep you from slicing off your poor fingers.)"
- "In a bowl, mix the ricotta or cottage cheese and your preferred spices. I like to add garlic (minced or powdered), a little bit of salt, a few twists of pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. You could add basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, sage, whatever you prefer."
- "Tip: if you‚Äôre using cottage cheese instead of ricotta, use small curd and try to drain off some of the whey before you add in all of your spices. If you forget that step or just can&#39;t be bothered (sometimes you just don&#39;t wanna, right?), consider sprinkling in something like dried lentils or split peas to soak up some of the extra liquid, unless you don‚Äôt mind the result being a little soupy! Whatever makes you happy, it‚Äôs your food! üòÅ"
- "Prep your spinach: if it&#39;s fresh, wash it and snap off the stems (unless you like the stems); if it&#39;s frozen, thaw it in the microwave; if it&#39;s canned, drain it."
- "If you&#39;re using canned or frozen spinach, add it to the ricotta/cottage cheese mix. Otherwise, set it aside (you&#39;ll be using it as a layer)."
- "In your baking dish, smear a thin layer of your fave pasta sauce, maybe 1-2 spoonfuls. (Make sure this is a bowl that will fit into your Instant Pot&#39;s inner bowl, if you&#39;re using an IP.)"
- "On top of the sauce, add a layer of sweet potato; make sure there&#39;s some overlap so that you can&#39;t see any of the layer under it between the slices."
- "Add a thin layer of your cheese mix on top of the sweet potato. It can be a bit tricky to spread it without moving the potato around, but the sauce below it will help keep things in place."
- "If you&#39;re using fresh leafy veg, add some of that on top of the cheese mix. If all of your veggies are mixed in with the cheese, add a layer of sliced sweet potato."
- "I added some dried lentils on top of this layer of cheese because I wanted to add some lentil-y texture."
- "Keep layering the veg and sweet potato and cheese until you run out or get close to the top of the dish. Add a thin layer of your favorite pasta sauce, then top that with as much shredded cheese as you like."
- "In your Instant Pot&#39;s metal bowl, put down the metal trivet and add a cup of water (as per the usual IP instructions). Put the bowl of lasagna into the inner pot on top of the trivet, then load it up into the Instant Pot. Set it for 25 minutes on high pressure. Let it depressurize on its own after it&#39;s done."
- "Sweet potatoes should be tender and easily eaten with a fork."

<i>Before you jump to Sweet Potato Lasagna GF Instant Pot recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is basically making use of common sense.

##### The ingredients needed to prepare Sweet Potato Lasagna GF Instant Pot:

1. Provide 1 large sweet potato
1. Provide 2 cups ricotta or cottage cheese
1. Prepare 1/2 cup your favorite pasta sauce
1. Provide 1 cup spinach or some other yummy veg
1. Get  Olive oil (optional)
1. Take  Shredded cheese (Italian blend or mozzarella)
1. Take  Spices (see step #2 for details)


##### Steps to make Sweet Potato Lasagna GF Instant Pot:

1. Peel sweet potato and use a mandolin to (carefully!) slice sweet potato into thin slices. (Hint: search for &#34;slice-proof&#34; kitchen gloves; you can find them for as low as $10 and they&#39;ll keep you from slicing off your poor fingers.)
1. In a bowl, mix the ricotta or cottage cheese and your preferred spices. I like to add garlic (minced or powdered), a little bit of salt, a few twists of pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. You could add basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, sage, whatever you prefer.
1. Tip: if you‚Äôre using cottage cheese instead of ricotta, use small curd and try to drain off some of the whey before you add in all of your spices. If you forget that step or just can&#39;t be bothered (sometimes you just don&#39;t wanna, right?), consider sprinkling in something like dried lentils or split peas to soak up some of the extra liquid, unless you don‚Äôt mind the result being a little soupy! Whatever makes you happy, it‚Äôs your food! üòÅ
1. Prep your spinach: if it&#39;s fresh, wash it and snap off the stems (unless you like the stems); if it&#39;s frozen, thaw it in the microwave; if it&#39;s canned, drain it.
1. If you&#39;re using canned or frozen spinach, add it to the ricotta/cottage cheese mix. Otherwise, set it aside (you&#39;ll be using it as a layer).
1. In your baking dish, smear a thin layer of your fave pasta sauce, maybe 1-2 spoonfuls. (Make sure this is a bowl that will fit into your Instant Pot&#39;s inner bowl, if you&#39;re using an IP.)
1. On top of the sauce, add a layer of sweet potato; make sure there&#39;s some overlap so that you can&#39;t see any of the layer under it between the slices.
1. Add a thin layer of your cheese mix on top of the sweet potato. It can be a bit tricky to spread it without moving the potato around, but the sauce below it will help keep things in place.
1. If you&#39;re using fresh leafy veg, add some of that on top of the cheese mix. If all of your veggies are mixed in with the cheese, add a layer of sliced sweet potato.
1. I added some dried lentils on top of this layer of cheese because I wanted to add some lentil-y texture.
1. Keep layering the veg and sweet potato and cheese until you run out or get close to the top of the dish. Add a thin layer of your favorite pasta sauce, then top that with as much shredded cheese as you like.
1. In your Instant Pot&#39;s metal bowl, put down the metal trivet and add a cup of water (as per the usual IP instructions). Put the bowl of lasagna into the inner pot on top of the trivet, then load it up into the Instant Pot. Set it for 25 minutes on high pressure. Let it depressurize on its own after it&#39;s done.
1. Sweet potatoes should be tender and easily eaten with a fork.
