<i>Before you jump to Leah&#39;s Charoset recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as economically as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
