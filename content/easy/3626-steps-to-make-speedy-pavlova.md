It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, of course. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
