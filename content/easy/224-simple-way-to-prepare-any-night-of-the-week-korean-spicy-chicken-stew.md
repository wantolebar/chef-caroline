<i>Before you jump to Korean Spicy Chicken Stew recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. You can easily minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
