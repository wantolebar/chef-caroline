<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

The kitchen alone offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply using common sense.
