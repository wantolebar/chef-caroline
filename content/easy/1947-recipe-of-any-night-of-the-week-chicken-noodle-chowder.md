<i>Before you jump to Chicken Noodle Chowder recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
