<i>Before you jump to Ray&#39;s Pineapple Cream Carrot Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Take the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isnâ€™t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will decide to be idle and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have a single flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are a good deal of things that contribute to your getting healthy. An expensive gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Looking to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
