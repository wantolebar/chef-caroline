recipeinstructions:
- "Plug in your waffle maker and preheat. If you have the one mentioned above, turn the dial to three o&#39;clock."
- "Mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a large bowl."
- "Squeeze the orange into a jug and add the milk, oil and vanilla. Mix well."
- "Pour the liquid ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and whisk together well. You&#39;re looking for a single cream consistency."

- "Carefully check how the waffles are doing. Ours usually take about five minutes to cook although this will depend on your appliance. Don&#39;t make the mistake of yanking open the lid as this can split waffles if they aren&#39;t yet cooked or if the iron wasn&#39;t adequately oiled."
- "When the waffles are golden brown, carefully remove and divide between plates. Repeat two more times for the remaining 2/3 mixture."
- "Pour over the blueberry and maple syrup compote."

<i>Before you jump to Vegan waffles with warm blueberry and maple syrup compote recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. The sad thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Walk up the stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an attempt on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are lots of things you can do to become healthy. An costly gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthy isnâ€™t just about losing weight. You need your body to be powerful too.
