Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a spot to begin with as any. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen.

They cost a little bit more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. You also have to get the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place.

Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
