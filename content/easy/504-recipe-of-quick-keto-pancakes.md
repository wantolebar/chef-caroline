<i>Before you jump to Keto pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. You can easily reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
