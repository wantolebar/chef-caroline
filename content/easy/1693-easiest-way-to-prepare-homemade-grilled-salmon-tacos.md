<i>Before you jump to Grilled Salmon Tacos recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as efficiently as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
