recipeingredient:
- " Fresh Poblano peppers"
- " potatoes"
- " salt or more to taste"
- " black pepper or more to taste"
- " garlic powder to taste"
- " shredded cheese of your choice add more gradually by preference  I used a blend of Chihuahua and sharp cheddar cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "preheat oven to 425"
- "Peel potatoes &amp; put in pot covered with water and boil till soft  *just like making mashed potatoes* Once potatoes are soft,  remove from water &amp; place in a large bowl."
- "Meanwhile, wash all of the peppers including the stem."
- "Cut the peppers in half lengthwise. Carefully remove seeds leaving stem attached. *if the stem breaks off, no biggie! ;)*"
- "Once peppers are seedless,  place on a foil lined baking tray. Spray the foil with a little PAM cooking spray. Place halved peppers skin side up. Roast in oven for 10 minutes, not fully cooking pepper. Turn peppers over, leave oven on but get the peppers out of the oven to let cool a bit so you can fill them with the potato &amp; cheese filling."
- "Back to the potatoes....Start by mashing the soft boiled potatoes in a large bowl (I use a potato masher &amp; do this step by hand) Mash till there isn&#39;t many chunks left. Add the shredded cheese and mix. The cheese should melt in the potatoes giving a creamy cheesy consistency. Add salt, black pepper &amp; garlic powder &amp; mix, incorporating everything to the mixture well. Now taste it!  You can add more cheese &amp; seasoning to the potatoes if you desire."
- "Fill each pepper with 2-3 tablespoons (or more) of the potato &amp; cheese mixture &amp; top each pepper with a bit more cheese then put back in oven and bake for another 10 to 12 minutes or till cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve with rice &amp; beans or just put a pepper in a soft warm flour tortilla (remove stem of course!), fold like a burrito.  Enjoy!  ;)"
- "** Variations** you can easily change up the potato mixture by adding milk to soften the mixture or sour cream or even cream cheese for bolder richer flavors. You can add different herbs like chives or roasted garlic. Also try different mixtures of cheeses to top pepper.  Whatever you choose I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be delish!"

<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Although it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living just isn't that tough. It's related to being sensible, most of the time.
