It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen alone gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
