<i>Before you jump to Squash Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
