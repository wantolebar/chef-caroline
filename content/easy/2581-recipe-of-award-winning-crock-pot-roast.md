The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution.

Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of electricity is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power.
