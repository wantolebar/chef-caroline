Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Maybe the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is specifically effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
