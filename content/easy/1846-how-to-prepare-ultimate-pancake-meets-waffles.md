<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not working as economically as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that are more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's about being practical, most of the time.
