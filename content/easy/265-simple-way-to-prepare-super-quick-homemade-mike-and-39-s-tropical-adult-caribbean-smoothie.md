<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s Tropical Adult Caribbean Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Why don't we begin with something not that hard, changing the actual light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen. You need to change your incandescent lights by using energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more initially, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The family spends major time in the cooking area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This also takes place in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that tough. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
