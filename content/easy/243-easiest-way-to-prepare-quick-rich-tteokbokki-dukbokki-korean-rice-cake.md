<i>Before you jump to Rich Tteokbokki (dukbokki) korean rice cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Take the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isnâ€™t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Most people will decide to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Looking to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your healthfulness. You need to make your body as strong it can be.
