<i>Before you jump to Butter Brown Bananas in Ice cream, dessert recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
