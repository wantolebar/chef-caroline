recipeingredient:
- "2-2.5 pounds pork country ribs shoulderbutt picnic shoulder cut into 15 to 2 inch cubes"
- "2 Tablespoons minced garlic 3 to 4 cloves"
- "1/4-1/3 cup tightly packed brown sugar depending on how sweet you like your food dark preferable light ok"
- "1/8 cup fish sauce"
- "1 green onion chopped"
- "1 1/2 cups sliced onion about 1 small"
- "3/4 cup water"
- "2 Tablespoons soy sauce"
- "2 Tablespoons vinegar Distilled white apple cider or even red or white wine will work"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, combine the pork with the garlic, brown sugar, fish sauce and green onion. Mix thoroughly to ensure even distribution of the seasonings. The best way to do it is just to get in there with your hands and massage the pig. Time permitting, let the pork marinate for 20 minutes or so to allow the seasoning to penetrate the meat."
- "In deep skillet or pot, heat 2 Tablespoons of a neutral flavored oil over medium high heat and sear the pork, 4 or 5 pieces at a time (don&#39;t want to crowd the cooking surface) until the fatty bits get a rich, dark, caramel color, 2 to 2.5 minutes per side. This is one of those rare instances in which you could actually put the seared pork back into the bowl with the uncooked pork without worrying about contamination because all of it is going back into the pot to cook for a long time."
- "After the pork is seared, add the onions into the pot and saute until they just begin to become translucent, about 2 minutes. This quick saute develops the flavor of the onion and helps it hold some shape during the long simmer."
- "Put the pork back in the pot, and increase the heat to medium high. Add the water, soy sauce and vinegar, stir to ensure they get evenly distributed, and bring to a gentle boil (i.e., the liquid is bubbling gently and consistently but not so actively that it splatters)."
- "Reduce the heat to medium low and cover the pot. Simmer 45 to 50 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes or so to ensure that the meat gets evenly seasoned and cooked. Because heat accumulates, watch for signs that it&#39;s getting too high (the aforementioned splattery bubbling) and adjust back down if that happens.  At this point, the meat should be fork tender. If not, cover and simmer another 5 minutes or so."
- "Once the meat is fork tender, uncover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer another 15 minutes to reduce, thicken and further caramelize the braising liquid. Stir every 5 minutes to further ensure even seasoning and cooking.  If you refrigerate the leftovers, you&#39;ll find that the braising liquid becomes gelatinous due to the collagen from the pork. Just give it a warming on the stove or a zap in the microwave, and it&#39;s back to its saucy goodness in no time.  Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Vietnamese Caramelized Pork recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is finished, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Consider the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are a good deal of things that work toward your getting healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. You want your body to be powerful too.
