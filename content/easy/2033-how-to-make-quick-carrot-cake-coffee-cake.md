<i>Before you jump to Carrot Cake Coffee Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. It's about being sensible, usually.
