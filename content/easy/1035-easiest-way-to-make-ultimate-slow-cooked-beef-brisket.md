<i>Before you jump to Slow Cooked Beef Brisket recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. By cool drying or air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. It's about being practical, most of the time.
