<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as efficiently as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that hard. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
