- "Cube the carrots and potatoes. Dice the onion and bacon."
- "In a large pot, heat a little oil and cook the onions and bacon until onions are translucent."
- "Add carrots, potatoes, lentils and bay leaf to the pot and pour in enough water and/or broth to cover everything. Bring to a boil."
- "Add red wine and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook about 30 minutes or until soft the lentils are soft."
- "Add whole sausages and let cook another 5-10 minutes."
