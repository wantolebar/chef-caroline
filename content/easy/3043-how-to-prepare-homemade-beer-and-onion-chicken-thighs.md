Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, after all. A lot of it is simply making use of common sense.
