- "10 Kirby Cucumbers"
- "5 medium Jalapeno peppers"
- "1 large red bell pepper"
- "1/2 medium red onion"
- "4 cup apple cider vinegar"
- "4 cup filtered water"
- "4 1/2 tbsp pickling salt"
- "12 clove garlic smashed and peeled"
- "8 tsp dill seeds"
- "4 tsp black peppercorns"
- "2 tsp red chile flakes"
- "4 quart canning jars with fresh lids"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash jars thoroughly in warm, soapy water. If you plan on making shelf stable pickles, prepare a boiling water bath canner. Put fresh canning jar lids into a small saucepan with 3 inches of water and set to the barest simmer."
- "Wash and dry kirby cucumbers. Remove blossom end. Cut into 1/4&#34; thick slices."
- "Wash and dry Jalapeno peppers. Remove stems. Cut into 1/4&#34; thick slices and remove seeds."
- "Wash and dry red bell pepper. Remove stem. Cut into 1/4&#34; thick slices and remove seeds."
- "Cut red onion into 1/4&#34; thick slices."
- "Combine vinegar, water and salt in sauce pan and bring to a boil."
- "Place all the veggies in a large bowl and toss until they are mixed together well."
- "Equally divide the veggies between the jars."
- "Equally divide garlic cloves, dill seed, black peppercorns and red chili flakes between the jars."
- "Pour the brine into the jars, leaving at least 1/4 inch headspace (that&#39;s the amount of space between the surface of the brine and the rim of the jar)."
- "Remove any air bubbles from jars by gently tapping them. I use the handle of a wooden spoon to make sure the brine is well integrated and all the bubbles are out."
- "Wipe rims and apply lids and bands (don&#39;t screw them on too tightly)."
- "If processing jars for shelf stability, lower jars into your processing pot. When water returns to a boil, set a timer for 10 minutes. When time is up, remove jars from canning pot and allow them to cool. When jars are cool enough to handle, check seals."
- "If your&#39;re not processing the jars for shelf stability, let them cool before putting them into the refrigerator. Do note that your jars may seal during the cooling process. However, without the boiling water bath process, that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re shelf stable. They still must be refrigerated."
- "Let pickles rest for at least one week before eating."

<i>Before you jump to Spicy Dill Pickles with Jalapenos recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. When our work day is complete, most people do not want to go to the gym. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Pick water over other drinks. Sipping a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. It is, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. When you choose water over other beverages you are helping your body remain very healthy and hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories from your diet— without having to resort to terrible tasting diet food. Effective weight loss efforts often depend solely on water intake.

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indication of your lifestyle choices. It has more to do with making your body as sturdy as it can be.
