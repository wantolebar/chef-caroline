- " Chicken wings"
- " Tamarind fruit"
- " Chipotle peppers"
- " ground cumin"
- " cayenne pepper"
- " Onion powder"
- " garlic powder"
- " Knorr chicken flavor bouillon"
- " clover honey"
- " brown sugar"
- " salt"
- " ground cinnamon"
- " boiling water"
recipeinstructions:
- "If necessary, wash and/or thaw chicken wings. Season with Goya all-purpose seasoning or just salt and pepper. Set aside."
- "Now for the fun part, getting the pulp from the tamarind fruit. Begin with 2 cups of water - bring to a boil. Meanwhile, peel the tamarind. Remove as much peel as possible without being too meticulous. Throw the fruit into the boiling water. Stir, stir, stir, until all the pulp dissolves. Strain the saucy pulp using a colander with big holes.  Get rid of the seeds and remaining skin, you won&#39;t need them. Or just chew on them! ðŸ˜œ"
- "Next,  we&#39;ll make the sauce. Please note, acidity in tamarind fruit may vary. For this reason, it is necessary that you adjust acidity to your liking. Brown sugar can be used for fine-tuning. Just don&#39;t make it too sweet!"
- "Pour all the ingredients in the blender. (except for the Chicken Wings, of course ðŸ˜ƒ) Switch it on and blend until smooth."
- "Taste!  Sauce should be sweet and sour. A little spicy and a little Smokey, perfect! If it&#39;s too sweet, well...  Not so good. If necessary, add brown sugar and blend little by little."
- "Preheat oven to 400Â°F Put wings in oven safe dish. Brush tamarind-chipotle sauce over wings generously."
- "Bake for 30 minutes.  Take wings out. Remove &#34;juice.&#34; Flip, brush sauce on wings. Just pour the remainder of the sauce over the wings, it won&#39;t hurt ðŸ˜ƒ."
- "Bake for an additional 15 to 30 minutes.  Check wings with fork after 15 minutes. Aim for juiciness and tenderness. TIP: the secret to perfectly glazed wings is to not move wings too much. Just let the sauce get thick and yummy on top of the wings."
- "PS: if you wish to accelerate the cooking process and increase crispiness of wings,  pan fry them first. On a medium pan, pour a little olive oil and fry wings using medium-high fire. Don&#39;t let the wings cook all the way through. Only the outside should become a little browned. Then bake as per above. This will inevitably reduce the juiciness of the Chicken."
- "Enjoy while still hot! Happy cooking ðŸ˜ƒ."

<i>Before you jump to Tamarind-chipotle Chicken Wings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
