<i>Before you jump to Easy Prime Rib recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
