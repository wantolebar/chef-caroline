<i>Before you jump to Super Easy Parmesan &amp; Italian Bread Crumbed Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to operate as often.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
