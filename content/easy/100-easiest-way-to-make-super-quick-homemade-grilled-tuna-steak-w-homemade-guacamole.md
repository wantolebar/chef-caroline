<i>Before you jump to Grilled Tuna Steak w/ Homemade Guacamole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

You may prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
