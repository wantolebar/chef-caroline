<i>Before you jump to Vegetarian Thai green curry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as effectively as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. It's about being functional, more often than not.
