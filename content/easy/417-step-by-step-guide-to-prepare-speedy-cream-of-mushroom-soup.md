Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as efficiently as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. It's concerning being practical, most of the time.
