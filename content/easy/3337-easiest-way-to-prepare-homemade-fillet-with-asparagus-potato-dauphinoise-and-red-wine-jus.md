recipeingredient:
- " Jus"
- "100 ml red wine"
- "100 ml port wine"
- "3 sprigs rosemary"
- "2 cloves garlic"
- " Asparagus"
- "2 packets asparagus"
- "50 g butter"

- "50 g butter"
- "10 g curled leaf parsley"
- "1 clove minced garlic"
- "10 g chives"
- " Steak"
- " Fillet steak"
- "50 g butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "To make the dauphinoise, slice the potatoes thinly. Place a small scoop of butter at the bottom of the pot and then layer your potatoes on top. In-between each layer, add some thin slices of garlic and some butter. Once all the potato is used, pour enough cream to cover the potatoes and bake for 30 minutes."
- "For the asparagus, cut the ends off and place in a hot pan with butter. Turn down the heat and add the Clive of garlic, and leave to cook with the lid on."
- "Fillet is a hard cut to cook, but with time and skill, it becomes a breeze. Make sure the pan is very hot with a drizzle of olive oil. When it&#39;s shimmering it&#39;s ready. Make sure you have seasoned your steaks well in advance and are at room temperature."
- "Place the steak onto the pan and leave for a minute just to sear that side. Then flip the steaks, to sear the other side. Add in the butter and the garlic and rosemary for the jus. You didn&#39;t read that wrong, you do need to use the one for the jus."
- "Baste the steaks in the hot, herby butter and when the steak looks and feels ready, it is ready to come out and rest."
- "Whilst it is resting, pour the red wine and port into the same pan and deglaze. Cook the alcohol off until the sauce is thick."
- "DO THIS STEP AN HOUR IN ADVANCE. For the compound butter, mash the butter, parsely, garlic and chives together with a pestle and mortar. Roll the butter into a small sausage with cling film and freeze until hard. Once solid, place into the fridge."
- "Serve the dauphinoise in its pot with a garnish of curled leaf parsley. Lay the steak on top of the sautéed asparagus and place a slice of compound butter on the top. Drizzle the sauce around the sides and on the steak and serve for a delicious meal. Bon appetit!"

<i>Before you jump to Fillet with Asparagus, Potato dauphinoise and red wine jus recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some hints to be as healthful as possible.

Make smart decisions when shopping for groceries. When you make wise choices at the grocery store, your meals will get healthier immediately. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with packed grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to get home immediately and eat something beneficial. Your home should be stored with healthy foods and ingredients. This makes it effortless to have a great meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is naturally better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are many things you can do to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. You need to help make your body as strong it can be.
