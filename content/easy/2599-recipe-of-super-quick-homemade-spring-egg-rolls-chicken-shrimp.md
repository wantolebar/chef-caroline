<i>Before you jump to Spring/Egg Rolls (Chicken/Shrimp) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
