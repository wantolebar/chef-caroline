<i>Before you jump to Blueberry Mug Cake #mugcakeweek recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is something we can all do, without difficulty. Mostly, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
