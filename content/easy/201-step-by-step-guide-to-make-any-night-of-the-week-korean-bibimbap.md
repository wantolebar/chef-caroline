<i>Before you jump to Korean Bibimbap recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
