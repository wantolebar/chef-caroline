You really need to replace your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house at the same time. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.
