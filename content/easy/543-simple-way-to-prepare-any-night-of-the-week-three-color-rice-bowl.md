<i>Before you jump to Three Color Rice Bowl recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthful, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally scrumptious salad (unless we’re vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are conscientious you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

Take the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as easy to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do plenty to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Looking to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about slimming down. You need your body to be powerful too.
