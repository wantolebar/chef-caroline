<i>Before you jump to Stuffed Dosa Roll recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. Particularly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. It's about being functional, usually.
