<i>Before you jump to Soya chilli recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Maybe the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. When you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
