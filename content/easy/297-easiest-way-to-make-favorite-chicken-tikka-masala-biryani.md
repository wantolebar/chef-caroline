While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong.

By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.
