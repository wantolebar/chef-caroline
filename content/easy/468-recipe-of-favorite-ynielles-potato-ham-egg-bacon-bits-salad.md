<i>Before you jump to Ynielle’s Potato Ham Egg Bacon Bits Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Start with changing the lights. Do this for your house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Making use of these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Coupled with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and discover how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
