Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely making use of common sense.
