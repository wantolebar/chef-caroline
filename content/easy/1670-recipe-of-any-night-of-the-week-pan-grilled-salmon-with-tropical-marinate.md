<i>Before you jump to Pan grilled Salmon with tropical marinate recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
