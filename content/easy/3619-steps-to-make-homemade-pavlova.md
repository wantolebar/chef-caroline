Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows.

These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Using these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to acquire the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. The kitchen lights especially tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there.

Do an exercise if you like; check out how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. Mostly, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
