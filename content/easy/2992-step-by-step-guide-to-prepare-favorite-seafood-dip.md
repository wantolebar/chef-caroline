<i>Before you jump to Seafood Dip recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not working as effectively as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite straightforward to live green, after all. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
