A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently.

Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that difficult. Typically, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
