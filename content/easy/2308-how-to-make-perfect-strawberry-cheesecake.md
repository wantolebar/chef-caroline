A massive amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently.

One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it truly is basically utilizing common sense.
