recipeinstructions:
- "Heat milk (slightly more than warm, not hot!) Add yeast and a pinch of sugar to milk, stir, and allow to sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes, or until foaming."
- "Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer, combine flour, sugar, salt, and nutmeg. Affix dough hook, or if using bowl, mix with spoon. Add yeast mixture. Mix for 1 minute or until barely combined."
- "Add eggs and mix on medium speed for about 5 minutes, or until the dough pulls away from the bowl of the mixer, and forms a cohesive ball. Add half the butter, and beat on medium speed for 5-7 minute or knead using hands until incorporated"
- "Repeat with remaining butter, adding flour 1 tablespoon at a time if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball, place in a large buttered bowl, and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Place in an off oven and allow to rise for 1 1/2 hours."
- "Remove dough, punch down, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight (or at a minimum of 4 hours)."
- "Syrup: To make simple syrup, combine sugar and water, and simmer until syrupy, about 15 minutes. Allow to cool completely."
- "If making chocolate babka, melt butter and chocolate together on medium power in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until completely smooth. Whisk in espresso powder, cocoa powder, and powdered sugar until a spreadable paste forms."
- "If making cinnamon babka, combine cinnamon, sugar, and melted butter, combining thoroughly until a spreadable paste forms."
- "Remove dough from the refrigerator, divide in half, and roll out to a 24 x 18 inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Spread evenly with desired filling, leaving a 1-inch gap around all sides. Roll into log lengthwise, and place in the freezer for 15-20 minutes, or until firm. Repeat with the other half of dough."
- "Remove dough roll from the freezer, and using a bread knife, cut down the middle lengthwise, exposing all the chocolate/cinnamon layers. Hold the two halves of dough against each other so the cut sides are facing out, and twist into a decorative loaf. Watch the video to see it done! Place in buttered, parchment-lined loaf pans, cover with a samp towel, and allow to rise in the off oven for 1 1/2 hours."
- "Preheat oven to 180 degrees and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the thickest part of the loaf comes out clean."
- "Remove from the oven, place on wire racks, and immediately brush down with syrup. Allow to cool for at least an hour before slicing and serving."

<i>Before you jump to Classic babka recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Perhaps the food just isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, nonetheless that is definitely not true. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
