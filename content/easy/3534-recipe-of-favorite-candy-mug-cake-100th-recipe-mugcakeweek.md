<i>Before you jump to Candy Mug Cake (100th recipe) #mugcakeweek recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Start out with exchanging the lights. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent style, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a small amount more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than just swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The family spends major time in the kitchen area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and discover just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
