<i>Before you jump to Yummy custardy  fruit tart recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a place to start as any. Do this for your house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you must use them rather than incandescent lights. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The family spends a lot of time in the cooking area, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house as well. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. It's about being functional, most of the time.
