<i>Before you jump to Fattoush recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Let's begin with something really easy, changing the actual light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent style, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than merely swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
