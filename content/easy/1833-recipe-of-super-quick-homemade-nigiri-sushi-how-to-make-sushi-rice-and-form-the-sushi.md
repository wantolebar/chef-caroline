recipeingredient:
- "1000 grams White cooked rice"
- "80 ml Vinegar"
- "20 grams Salt"
- "50 grams Sugar"
- "55 to 60 pieces Toppings neta of your choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the sushi vinegar ingredients and mix together well. Put into a pan and heat over low heat. When the sugar and salt have dissolved, it&#39;s done."
- "Use freshly cooked rice. If you use rice that&#39;s been kept warm for a while, it won&#39;t absorb the sushi vinegar and will become wet and soggy. Use a bit less water than usual when cooking the rice."
- "Transfer the freshly cooked rice to a pre-moistened wooden sushi tub, and pour on the sushi vinegar. Cut the vinegar into the rice with a rice paddle. Don&#39;t knead the rice."
- "Fan the rice to evaporate any excess moisture. This also adds shine to the rice grains,"
- "When the rice has cooled down to the point where you can touch it with your hands, cover it with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, then with the lid."
- "Each piece of nigiri sushi weighs about 16-18 g. With 3 rice cooker cups worth of rice (before cooking) you can make 55 to 60 pieces. When slicing the fish, slice against the grain."
- "If you hold the knife vertically 2 mm before you slice though the fish, the cut side will have a nice and clean finish."
- "This is how it looks when you hold the knife blade vertically. The right side of the slice will be a bit thicker."
- "Moisten your hands with vinegar-water (50/50 rice vinegar and water mixed together). Hold a piece of topping (a fish slice here) in your right hand, and spread on a tiny bit of wasabi with your left index finger."
- "Make a small round ball of sushi rice and place it on the topping. Make a dent in the sushi rice with your left thumb. This makes a packed sushi rice that is soft and gently falls apart in your mouth."
- "Press the top and bottom of the shari with your right thumb and index finger."
- "Press the shari with your right index finger to form the bottom of the sushi."
- "Roll the whole sushi in your palm and turn it over so that the topping is on top."
- "Press both sides with your right thumb and index finger."
- "Press the top of the sushi with your left thumb while you press down with your right index finger."
- "Flip it over."
- "Press the sides as in Step 14."
- "Press the top of the sushi with your left thumb while you press down on it with your right index finger, as in Step 15."
- "The nigiri sushi is complete, but if it feels too loose, repeat Steps 13 to 15 again."
- "Try making the sushi with all kinds of toppings - it&#39;s fun!"

Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the conclusion of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym.

Fill your cabinets with healthy foods. This makes it easy to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets.
