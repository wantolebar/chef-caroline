recipeinstructions:

- "If the garlic is sizzling, the heat is too high.*  Let the oil infused with the ingredients for about 10 to 15 mins or until the garlic starts to brown.  Remove from heat and transfer into a bowl of canned diced tomatoes.  *You can pass the oil mixture thru a fine sieve to catch all the garlic, chili and seasonings.*"

- "Preheat oven to 200 degree celsius or 400 fahrenheit.  Slice the eggplants lengthwise to 6 slices per eggplant.  Lay the eggplant slices on a wire rack."
- "Lightly seasoning with salt.  Set aside for about 15 mins. This will allow the eggplant to release some of its bitter moisture.  Pad the eggplant slices dry."

- "Once the oil is heated up, add in the ground chicken.  Using a spatula to break the chicken into bits and pieces.  Season generously with salt, white pepper and mushroom powder."
- "Cook the chicken until slightly brown.  Add in about 1 cup of the tomato sauce.  *Depending on what consistency you are looking for. If you prefer saucy, add more tomato sauce.*  Stir to combine well."
- "Lastly, taste and adjust for seasonings.  Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly.  Spoon some of the tomato-chicken sauce onto a slice of eggplant.  Sprinkle some mozzarella over the top."
- "Lay another slice of eggplant on top of the cheese.  Repeat the layering process until you have a stack of 3 eggplants.  Scatter some parmigiano over the top.  Repeat the process for the remaining eggplants."
- "Wack back into the oven and bake until the cheeses have melted.  Remove from the oven.  Transfer onto serving plates."
- "Garnish with some basil over the top.  Serve immediately."

<i>Before you jump to Eggplant Lasagna recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

You may possibly prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you a lot less money. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is not true. A dishwasher is specifically effective when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not really that hard. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
