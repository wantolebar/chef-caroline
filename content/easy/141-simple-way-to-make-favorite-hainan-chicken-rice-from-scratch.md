recipeinstructions:
- "PICKLES; once you&#39;ve cut the cucumber, radish and carrots into matchsticks, put them in a bowl and add 1/3 cup of rice vinegar, 2 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp Salt. Mix well and serve in a saucer."
- "SPRING ONION &amp; GINGER DIP; Finely chop the Spring Onions, Ginger and then add 1/4 tsp Salt. Mix well in a bowl. In a saucepan, heat up 3 Tbsp of Cooking Oil until hot and then TURN OFF THE HEAT. Add the veggies to the oil and mix well. Serve it in a dipping bowl."

- "BUTCHERING; A simpler way is to parboil the chicken and then debone it but then the cooking time will take too long. Instead, debone the entire chicken first; separate the bones, the extra skin and fats from the carcass, and the meat. Keep the skin on with the meat cuts and discard the head, the feet and the innards. SEASON the Chicken Meat with 1 tsp Salt and set aside."

To check whether the chicken is done, take a skewer and poke the thickest middle part. Place the skewer on your lips to test the heat. If it&#39;s hot then it&#39;s done. Remove and proceed to the Ice Bath."
- "ICE BATH; Prepare a bowl with Ice, 1.5 cup Stock, Fish Sauce, Rice Vinegar and marinate the Chicken Meat for 20 minutes. The ice bath will shock the skin and give it a better texture as well as marinating the chicken."
- "SCHMALTZ; Cut up the Chicken Skin into pieces. In a wok, heat up the chicken fats with with 1/2 cup water (or more) and cook until the liquid has turned yellow, the skins have browned, the water has evaporated and the fats are sizzling. Discard the skins and proceed to saute the garlic."
- "SAUTE GARLIC &amp; RICE; add 30g of Garlic into the pot with Schmaltz and fry it until fragrant. Then add 2 cups of White Rice. Mix well and toss for a minute."
- "COOK THE RICE; add 2 cups of Stock in the rice pot with 1/4 tsp of Salt (2 pinches). Cook on low heat until all the moisture has left. When the liquid is gone, turn off the heat and comb the rice. Cover with a lid and let it rest for 10 minutes."

<i>Before you jump to Hainan Chicken Rice (from scratch) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn‚Äôt have to be a pain. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthful.

Run the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. This isn't as effortless to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? Most people will decide to be lazy and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. Even just a individual flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. Little things, when done each day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn‚Äôt just about reducing your weight. You need to make your body as strong as possible.
