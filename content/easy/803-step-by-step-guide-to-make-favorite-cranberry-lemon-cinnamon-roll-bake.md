Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that hard. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
