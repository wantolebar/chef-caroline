Changing light bulbs is as good a place to begin with as any. This will go outside of the kitchen, nonetheless that is okay. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent style, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy.

And it's not limited to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.
