Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These types of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as economically as they should. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to run as often.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
