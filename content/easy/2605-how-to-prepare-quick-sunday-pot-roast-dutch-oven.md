Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. You can easily save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. It's concerning being functional, most of the time.
