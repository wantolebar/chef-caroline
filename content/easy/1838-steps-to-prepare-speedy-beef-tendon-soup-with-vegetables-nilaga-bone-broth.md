- "2 carrots quartered"
- "1 stalk leek cut crosswise optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Since this is beef tendon, you&#39;ll need a pressure cooker! Rub salt and pepper all over the beef. Add in the bones (this is what makes it tasty!), the beef meat, and the tendon in the pot. Throw in one of the onions, the bay leaves and 3 garlic cloves. Add the bullion cube and 3-4 cups water, depending on size of your pot. It should cover the beef."
- "Cover properly and pressure cook for 15 mins- btw only start timing it when it starts to whistle. So that means its actually in the pot for more than 15... Take note of this."
- "When it&#39;s time, turn off the heat and follow your pressure cooker instructions to avoid getting scalded with boiling liquid!"
- "After opening, bring it back to the stove. Taste and adjust accordingly. Add your potatoes and the remaining onions, garlic. Simmer on medium heat covered. About 10 mins."
- "Add your carrots, simmer for another 7 minutes."
- "Add green beans, leeks, cover another 3 mins. I normally add one red finger chili at this point, and I run my knife in the middle to let the heat come out when cooking. Gives just enough spiciness to the soup. ;)"
- "Taste, adjust saltines or spiciness. Add the the pechay, cover for another minute then turn off the heat."
- "Leave it covered for another 2 minutes then separate the veggies unto a plate to prevent over cooking."
- "Serve while hot. Eat with rice (in Asia)."

<i>Before you jump to Beef Tendon Soup with vegetables / Nilaga / Bone Broth recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesnâ€™t have to be a chore. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some simple ways to get healthy.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the higher floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people choose the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even just a individual flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are a good deal of things that work toward your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being smart about the choices you make each day is a start. Getting as much physical exercise as you possibly can is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your health levels. You really want your body to be powerful too.
