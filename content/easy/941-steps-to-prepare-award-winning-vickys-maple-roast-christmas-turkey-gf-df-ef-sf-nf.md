recipeingredient:
- " large turkey around 6kg 14lbs giblets removed"
- " lemons halved"
- " sunflower spread  butter"
- " medium onions peeled and quartered"
- " fresh thyme"
- " streaky bacon or pancetta"
- " maple syrup"
- " ground cinnamon"
- " cornstarch  cornflour"
- " hot chicken or turkey stock"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to gas 6 / 200C / 400°F"
- "Mix the juice of 1 of the lemons with 3/4 of the butter, melted. Set aside the squeezed lemon halves, we&#39;ll use them in a minute"
- "Fry the onion quarters in the rest of the butter on a low heat for 5 minutes then set aside to cool"
- "Making sure the giblets have been removed first, fill the turkey cavity with the onions, the squeezed and unsqueezed lemon shells and the thyme sprigs. Close and secure with a cocktail stick"
- "Slid your fingers under the skin around the neck, over the breast meat and spoon some of the lemon butter into the pockets you&#39;ve made. Rub the rest over the skin, not forgetting the legs and wings"
- "Slice the bacon in half lengthwise if it&#39;s wide and arrange over the breast in a lattice pattern. It will shrink back a bit during cooking. Cover loosely with foil if you don&#39;t have a roasting pot with a lid"
- "For turkeys over 4kg / 9lbs, allow 20 minutes per kg (first 20 minutes at a higher temp), plus 90 minutes with the oven slightly lower. For birds under 4kg / 9lbs the time is still 20 minutes per kilo but then only 70 minutes to finish"
- "So based on my 6kg bird shown, cook it for 20 minutes at the preheated temp, then reduce the oven down to gas 4 / 180C / 350°F and cook for another 4 hours (last half hour step below)"
- "Mix the maple syrup with the cinnamon and 30 minutes before the end of the cooking time, remove the lid / foil and brush the syrup mixture over the bird. Return to the oven uncovered for the final 30 minutes"
- "To test if it’s ready, pierce the thickest part of the thigh with a skewer. If the juices are clear, it’s cooked. If they are pink, return it to the oven for another 15 minutes and keep checking until cooked. Once cooked, tilt the tray gently so any juices run out into the corner"
- "Transfer the roast to a platter and cover in foil. Put a tea towel on top to keep it warm and leave to rest for 20 minutes while you get on with the gravy. A roast bird covered this way will keep it&#39;s temp for almost a whole hour, so you&#39;ve plenty of time to do sides even if your oven is small"
- "To make the gravy, skim the fat from the juices in the roasting tin and discard, then stir in the flour. There will be quite a lot of fat because of the butter. Cook on the stove top for 4 minutes, stirring, then gradually stir in the stock until thickened. Heat until simmering, stir, then serve"
- "This size of bird will feed a good 12 - 14 adults. Try my cornbread stuffing side dish with it!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/350505-vickys-cornbread-stuffing-gluten-dairy-egg-soy-free"

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as economically as they should. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, after all. A lot of it truly is merely making use of common sense.
