<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Especially if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that hard. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
