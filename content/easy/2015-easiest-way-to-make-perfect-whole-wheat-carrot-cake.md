<i>Before you jump to Whole Wheat Carrot Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Maybe the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
