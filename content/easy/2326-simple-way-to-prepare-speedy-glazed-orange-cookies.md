- "In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside."
- "In a small bowl, combine the the sugar and orange zest, rubbing them together with your fingers until the zest is completely incorporated into the sugar."
- "Cream together the butter and the orange zest-infused sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and orange and mix until combined, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed.

Let cool for 5 to 10 minutes on the cookie sheet, and then remove to a cooling rack to cool completely."
- "Make the Sweet Orange Glaze: Whisk together the powdered sugar, orange zest, and enough orange juice to achieve the desired consistency (less juice for a thicker glaze, more for a thinner one). Spread glaze over top of the cooled cookies, and allow to set at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Store at room temperature in an airtight container (divide layers with wax paper so the cookies don&#39;t stick together)."

<i>Before you jump to Glazed Orange Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be thankful to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Walk up the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be tough to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when walked up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are a whole lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Don't ignore that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You want your body to be powerful too.
