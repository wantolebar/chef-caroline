<i>Before you jump to Crispy, Crusty, Pizza Dough recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Begin with exchanging the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more originally, these bulbs last as long as ten of the conventional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Obviously this also happens in some other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that hard. A lot of it truly is basically using common sense.
