recipeingredient:
- "200 g Pork Mince"
- "400 g cutminced vegetables we used carrots cabbage onions bean sprouts  think one of those Tescos Stir Fry packs"
- "2 tbsp Sesame Oil"
- "1/2 tsp crushed Kallo Just Bouillon Beef Stock Cube"
- "1 tsp ground ginger"
- "Pinch ground garlic"
- "Pinch black pepper"
- "35 GF Rice paper sheets sometimes it makes more"
- " for vegetarian replace the pork mince with minced mushrooms  add some spring onion for extra flavour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the pork and vegetables together. Add in 1 tbsp of sesame oil, and the seasonings. Mix well"
- "Follow the instructions for the rice paper. Normally you will need to soak each sheet of paper for 2 seconds in warm water. From there lay it flat on a plate to sit for another minute or two. It will be ready to roll when it feels soft and pliable."
- "Place a small amount (tsp) of the mixture in the centre of the rice paper. As the rice paper is much softer than normal gyoza dough, I find that being able to cover the filling with two or three turns of the rice paper will prevent breakage. This is where I messed up the first time I made these - but learned from it on round two :)"
- "Place 1 tbsp of sesame oil in a pan on medium heat. Add a little olive oil as well to really prevent those dumplings from sticking to the pan."
- "Cook for about 7 minutes, or until the pork seems to be cooked through. I usually put a cover on the pan in order to &#34;steam&#34; them through if you will. Some recipes recommend putting a bit of water in the pan to help with this process, but I haven&#39;t tried that with rice paper yet!"
- "Serve with some of Kikkoman&#39;s Gluten Free Soy Sauce! Enjoy!"

Choosing water instead of other beverage adds to your body's health and allows it stay hydrated. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food.
