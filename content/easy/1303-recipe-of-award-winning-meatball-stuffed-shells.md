<i>Before you jump to Meatball stuffed shells recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Save even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. It's related to being functional, usually.
