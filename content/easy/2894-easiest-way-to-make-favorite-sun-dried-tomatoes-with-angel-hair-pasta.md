<i>Before you jump to Sun dried tomatoes with angel hair pasta recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is specifically effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes with heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. A lot of it is basically making use of common sense.
