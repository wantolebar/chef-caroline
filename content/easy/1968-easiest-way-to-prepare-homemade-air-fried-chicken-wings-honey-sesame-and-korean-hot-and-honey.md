<i>Before you jump to Air Fried Chicken Wings (Honey Sesame and Korean Hot and Honey) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Maybe the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
