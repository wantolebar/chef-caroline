recipeinstructions:
- "Today&#39;s main dish is fresh gyoza!! I got 1 package for 99 yen!  Here I am going to make it taste just like it came from a restaurant."
- "Don&#39;t turn on the heat yet.  Drizzle some oil in a nonstick frying pan.  A cast iron frying pan is best, but most people have a nonstick pan."
- "Line up the gyoza like this.  Here I am using two packages.  When you have laid them out, you can turn on the heat.  High heat!"

- "Immediately add the water mixture to the frying pan.  Make it sizzle!!"
- "Cover with a lid for 5 to 10 minutes!"
- "Eventually the sizzling sound will grow fainter!"

- "Try to get them nice and golden brown!"
- "When it looks like this, stop the heat!  There should be no water left!  Check to make sure!  If there is water left you may get burned in the next step!"
- "Cover the gyoza with a plate that is slightly smaller than the pan."
- "Support the plate with your left hand..."
- "Leave the heavy lifting to your right hand."
- "Holding the pan at about shoulder height, turn it over forcefully to release the gyoza onto the plate.  This is dangerous, so you might ask your husband or boyfriend to do it for you! Once you get used to it, it&#39;s easy to pull off."
- "Look!  Such a beautiful golden colour!"
- "Did you know that if you pour the sauce directly on the gyoza, it will come unstuck? (Due to the vinegar)"

Those days are over, and it seems we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more.

You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong.
