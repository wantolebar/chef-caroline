- "For the optional milk chocolate frosting : sift together the confectioners sugar and cocoa powder to ensure there are no lumps. Set that aside.

<i>Before you jump to Homemade Fudgy Brownies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Begin with exchanging the light bulbs. Do this for the entire house, not merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. You also have to obtain the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The kitchen lights especially will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house as well. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
