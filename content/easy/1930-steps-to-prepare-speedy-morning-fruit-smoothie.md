<i>Before you jump to Morning Fruit Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. Mainly if you make certain the dishwasher is full prior to starting a cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living just isn't that difficult. It's related to being practical, most of the time.
