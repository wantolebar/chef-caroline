Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

A lot of electrical power is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
