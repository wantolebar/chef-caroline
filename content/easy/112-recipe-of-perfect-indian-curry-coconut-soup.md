Walk up the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a great way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors earlier and walk the rest of the way? Most people will choose to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and routines is where it begins.
