<i>Before you jump to Vickys Mexican-Style Pork with Corn Salsa, GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. It's related to being practical, usually.
