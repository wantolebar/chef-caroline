Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active participation.

Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good an area to start as any. This will probably go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Using these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to obtain the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. In the kitchen is where you'll regularly come across members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Of course this also happens in different rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and discover just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. It's about being practical, more often than not.
