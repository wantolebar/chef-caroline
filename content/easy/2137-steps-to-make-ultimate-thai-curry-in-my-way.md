<i>Before you jump to Thai curry in my way recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a place to start as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent style, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more initially, these bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. Along with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The kitchen lights especially tend to be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Certainly this also happens in some other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and see just how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is definitely something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
