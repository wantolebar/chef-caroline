<i>Before you jump to Veg pizza recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as economically as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. It's related to being functional, more often than not.
