<i>Before you jump to Strawberry Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
