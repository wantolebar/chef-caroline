Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Perhaps the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living is not that tough. A lot of it truly is simply using common sense.
