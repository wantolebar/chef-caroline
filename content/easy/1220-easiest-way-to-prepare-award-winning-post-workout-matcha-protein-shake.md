<i>Before you jump to Post-Workout Matcha Protein Shake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. You can certainly save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison with those from longer than ten years ago. The proper temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty straightforward to live green, after all. It's related to being functional, usually.
