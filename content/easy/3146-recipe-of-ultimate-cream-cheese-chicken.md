Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family ought to start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that hard. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
