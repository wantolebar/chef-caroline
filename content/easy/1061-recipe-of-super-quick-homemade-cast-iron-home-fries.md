<i>Before you jump to Cast Iron Home Fries recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not running as efficiently as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models which might be more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Natural living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
