<i>Before you jump to Poached eggs,samosa,hash browns and kachumbari recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a place to start as any. This will probably go outside of the kitchen, but that is okay. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. Coupled with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll usually discover members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house also. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, after all. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
