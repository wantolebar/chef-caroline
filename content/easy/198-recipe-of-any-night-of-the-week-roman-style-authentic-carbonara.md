recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Pasta of your choice"
- "3 eggs worth A Egg yolk you could also use 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk"
- "1 A Parmesan cheese"
- "1 clove Garlic finely chopped"
- "1/5 or 16 Onion finely chopped optional"
- "1 Bacon or pancetta is even better cut into 1 cm thick pieces"
- "30 ml Extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 Black pepper preferably coarsely ground"
recipeinstructions:
- "Fill a large pot with 3 liters of water and bring it to boil. This is the water to be used for cooking the pasta. Once the water begins to boil, add 2 tablespoons of salt (this amount is equal to 1% of the weight of the water)."
- "The amount of salt used in Step 1 will also add flavor. Measure out the salt carefully. When the pasta water comes to a boil, turn the heat down very low to have it ready."
- "Prepare and cut the garlic, bacon, and onion as noted in the ingredient list."
- "Combine the &#34;A&#34; ingredients and a dash each of salt and pepper in a bowl and mix well. * I use a small amount of salt and pepper since a lot of the salt will come from the bacon."
- "To drain the pasta, place a strainer over the top of another bowl, which should be larger than the bowl in Step 4. Prepare this beforehand in order to quickly use it as a double broiler."
- "Combine the olive oil, garlic, and bacon in an unheated frying pan and heat over low heat. * Thoroughly transfer the fragrance of each of the ingredients to the oil."
- "When the garlic from Step 6 becomes a light beige color, add the onion, salt, and pepper and heat over medium heat."
- "When the onion from Step 7 becomes translucent, remove from heat. Add the pasta to the boiling water from Step 2 and boil over low heat."
- "When the pasta is cooked to al dente, drain the pasta in the strainer from Step 5 and preserve the water in the bowl underneath."
- "Add the cooked pasta to the frying pan in Step 8 and mix well over a low-medium heat."
- "Add one ladle&#39;s worth of pasta water (or, if you&#39;re using a whole egg, add 0.6 ladle&#39;s worth) and the contents of the frying pan to the bowl in Step 4."
- "Place the bowl in Step 11 over the top of the bowl containing the remaining pasta water to create a double broiler. Heat the pasta and sauce using this method and mix well."
- "(Tip) This carbonara only uses egg for the sauce, so the sauce should become hard around the edges of the bowl. Continuously mix quickly, focusing on the edges of the bowl."
- "Once the egg sauce has reached a preferred thickness, transfer the sauce and pasta onto a plate, add plenty of black pepper, and you&#39;re done!"
- "I sliced Parmesan cheese and used it as a topping. Crisp bacon would also be really delicious."
- "Even though only egg is used for the sauce, by using a double broiler and adding a lot of the pasta water will produce a creamy sauce without lumps. If you have any leftover egg yolks, be sure to give this recipe a try!"
- "Here&#39;s a delicious way of making Authentic Carbonara.. Try this too!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/153137-absolutely-foolproof-authentic-carbonara"
- "Also try this version - &#34;Tomato Carbonara With Plenty Of Bacon&#34;. It&#39;s quite addictive.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/154144-tomato-carbonara-with-plenty-of-bacon"

<i>Before you jump to Roman-Style Authentic Carbonara recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't always enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy.

Be smart when you do your food shopping. If you make smart decisions when you are shopping for your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think for a second: you don't want to go to a stressful grocery store or sit in a long line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to go to your apartment and make a little something from your kitchen. Your kitchen should be filled with healthy foods and ingredients. This makes it simple to have a good meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do plenty to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthy isnâ€™t just about reducing your weight. You need to make your body as strong as possible.
