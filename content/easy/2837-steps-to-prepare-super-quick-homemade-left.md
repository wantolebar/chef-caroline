Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. It's about being functional, more often than not.
