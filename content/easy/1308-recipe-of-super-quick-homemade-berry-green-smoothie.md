<i>Before you jump to Berry Green Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not running as effectively as they should. You can easily save up to 60% on energy once you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to run less often, will also save electricity.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. Mostly, all it will take is a little common sense.
