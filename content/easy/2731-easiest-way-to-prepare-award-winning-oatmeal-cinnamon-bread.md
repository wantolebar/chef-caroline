<i>Before you jump to Oatmeal Cinnamon Bread recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Start out with replacing the lights. Do this for your house, not just the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are energy-savers, and you will need to use them rather than incandescent lights. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to obtain the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Obviously this also happens in some other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. Typically, all it takes is a little common sense.
