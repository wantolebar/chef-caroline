Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a place to begin with as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the cooking area. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent style, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. Along with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights specifically tend to be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, after all. A lot of it is simply using common sense.
