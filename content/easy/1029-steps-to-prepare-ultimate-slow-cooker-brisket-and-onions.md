It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not operating as efficiently as they should. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.

The kitchen alone offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. Typically, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
