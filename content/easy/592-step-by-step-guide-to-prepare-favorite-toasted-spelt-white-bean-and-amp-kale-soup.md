<i>Before you jump to Toasted Spelt, White Bean &amp; Kale Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that tough. It's about being practical, most of the time.
