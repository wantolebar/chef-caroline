If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.
