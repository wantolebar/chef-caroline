Changing light bulbs is definitely as good an area to begin with as any. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the cooking area. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent style, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Together with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently come across members of a family, and often the lights usually are not turned off until the last person goes to bed.

Do an exercise if you like; have a look at how much electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.
