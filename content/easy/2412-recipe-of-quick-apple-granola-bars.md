<i>Before you jump to Apple granola bars recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a wholesome and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. Going to the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some tips to be as healthful as possible.

Walk up the stairs. Instead of selecting the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even if you only have one flight to climb, climbing up and down it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. Not all of them require fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. It is the little things you choose day after day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Wanting to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You really want your body to be strong too.
