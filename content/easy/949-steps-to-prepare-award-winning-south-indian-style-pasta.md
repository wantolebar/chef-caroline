<i>Before you jump to South Indian style Pasta recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to go as often.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, of course. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
