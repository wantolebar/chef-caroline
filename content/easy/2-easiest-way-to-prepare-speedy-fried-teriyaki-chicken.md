It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it takes 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living just isn't that hard. It's about being sensible, more often than not.
