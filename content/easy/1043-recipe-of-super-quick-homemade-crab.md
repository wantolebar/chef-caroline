<i>Before you jump to Crab recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Dollars</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, nonetheless that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that hard. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
