recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the pancake mix and the cake flour and set aside. If using butter, melt it and set it aside."
- "Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the oil in the center. Add some water, a little a time, into the dry ingredients while shaping the dough into a ball with a spatula."
- "Wrap the dough in plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for as long as possible. (Cut the plastic wrap one size larger than the tart pan, since you will use it later when rolling out the dough.)"
- "Open the plastic wrap and cover the dough with another piece of plastic wrap. Roll the dough with a rolling pin to match the size of the tart pan. (This technique eliminates the need to dust the working surface.)"
- "Take off the top piece of plastic wrap, flip the crust over and into the tart pan with the bottom piece of plastic wrap attached. Shape the dough by pressing it into the tart pan over the plastic wrap to shape the crust. Cut off the excess edges with a rolling pin."
- "Slowly remove the plastic wrap. Pierce several holes in the bottom and grooves of the crust."
- "If you are blind-baking the crust, bake it at 180℃ for 10-30 minutes. (Adjust the temperature to the baking time or for the type of tart). If you have pie weights, it will turn out looking even better."

<i>Before you jump to Easy Healthy Tart Crust recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the end of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

When you go grocery shopping, be sensible about it. If you make smart decisions when you are purchasing your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think for a second: you don't want to go to a stressful grocery store or sit in a long line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to go home and make a little something from your kitchen. Your kitchen should be stored with healthy foods and ingredients. This way—even if you decide on something slightly greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still picking foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are plenty of things you can go after to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your health levels. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
