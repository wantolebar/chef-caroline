<i>Before you jump to Liver with ricotta cheese recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Probably the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Natural living is something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. It's about being functional, most of the time.
