<i>Before you jump to Elotes (Mexican Street Corn) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Begin with replacing the lights. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen area. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a small amount more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. Together with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The kitchen lights especially will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house at the same time. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and discover exactly how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. It's about being functional, usually.
