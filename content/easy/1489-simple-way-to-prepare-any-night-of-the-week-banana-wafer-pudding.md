Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. Mainly if you make certain the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
