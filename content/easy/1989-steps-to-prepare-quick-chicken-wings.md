<i>Before you jump to Chicken wings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good an area get started on as any. Complete this for your house, not just the kitchen. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a small amount more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it signifies that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than merely replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular are often left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This likewise happens in the rest of the house, but we are trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen alone offers you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that hard. Mostly, all it will take is a little common sense.
