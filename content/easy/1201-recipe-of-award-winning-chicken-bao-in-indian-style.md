<i>Before you jump to Chicken bao in indian style recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. You get the maximum energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's about being functional, usually.
