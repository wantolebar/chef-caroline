<i>Before you jump to Sunshine&#39;s mexican steak recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Take the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. If you do work on a very high floor, why not get off the elevator a few floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people choose the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are a whole lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being smart about the decisions you make each day is a start. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Remember: being healthy isn’t just about reducing your weight. You need to make your body as strong it can be.
