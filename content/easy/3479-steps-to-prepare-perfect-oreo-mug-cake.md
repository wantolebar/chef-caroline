<i>Before you jump to Oreo mug cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good a place to start as any. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house also. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that difficult. It's related to being practical, more often than not.
