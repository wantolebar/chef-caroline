recipeinstructions:
- "FOR THE DUXELLES:"
- "Add mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped."
- "Add butter and olive oil to a large saute pan and set over medium heat."
- "Add the shallot and mushroom mixture and saute for 8 to 10 minutes until most the liquid has evaporated."
- "Season with salt and pepper and set aside to cool."
- "FOR THE BEEF:"
- "Tie the tenderloin in 4 places so it holds its cylindrical shape while cooking."
- "Drizzle with olive oil, then season with salt and pepper and sear all over, including the ends, in a hot, heavy-based skillet lightly coated with olive oil - about 2 to 3 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, set out your prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrap (plastic needs to be about a foot and a half in length so you can wrap and tie the roast up in it) on top of your cutting board."
- "Shingle the prosciutto so it forms a rectangle that is big enough to encompass the entire filet of beef."
- "Using a rubber spatula, cover evenly with a thin layer of duxelles."
- "Season the surface of the duxelles with salt and pepper and sprinkle with fresh thyme leaves."
- "When the beef is seared, remove from heat, cut off twine, and smear lightly all over with Dijon mustard."
- "Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in the duxelles covered prosciutto using the plastic wrap to tie it nice and tight."
- "Tuck in the ends of the prosciutto as you roll to completely encompass the beef."
- "Roll it up tightly in plastic wrap and twist the ends to seal it completely and hold it in a nice log shape."
- "Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it maintains its shape."
- "Preheat the oven to 425°F."
- "On a lightly floured surface, roll the puff pastry out to about 1/4&#34; thickness."
- "Depending on the size of your sheets, you may have to overlap 2 sheets and press them together."
- "Remove beef from the refrigerator and cut off plastic."
- "Set the beef in the center of the pastry and fold over the longer sides, brushing with egg wash to seal. Trim ends if necessary then brush with egg wash and fold over to completely seal the beef."
- "Top with coarse salt."
- "Place the beef seam side down on a baking sheet."
- "Brush the top of the pastry with egg wash then make a couple of slits in the top of the pastry using the tip of a paring knife; this creates vents that will allow the steam to escape when cooking."
- "Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until pastry is golden brown and beef registers 125°F on an instant-read thermometer."
- "Remove from oven and rest 10 minutes before cutting into thick slices."
- "Garnish with minced chives and serve with green peppercorn sauce, roasted fingerling potatoes, and warm wilted winter greens."
- "FOR THE GREEN PEPPERCORN SAUCE:"
- "Add olive oil to pan after removing beef."
- "Add shallots, garlic, and thyme; saute for 1 to 2 minutes."
- "Off heat, add brandy and flambe using a long kitchen match."
- "After flame dies down, return to the heat, add stock, and reduce by about half."
- "Strain out solids, then add 2 cups of cream and mustard."
- "Reduce by half again, then shut off heat and add green peppercorns."
- "FOR THE ROASTED FINGERLING POTATOES with FRESH HERBS &amp; GARLIC:"
- "Preheat oven to 500°F and place a baking sheet inside to heat."
- "Add potatoes, rosemary, sage, thyme, and garlic to a medium bowl."
- "Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper."
- "Remove sheet from oven, lightly coat with olive oil, and pour potatoes onto pan."
- "Place potatoes in oven and reduce heat to 425°F."
- "Roast for 20 minutes, or until crispy on the outside and tender on the inside."
- "FOR THE WARM WILTED WINTER GREENS:"
- "Cook honey and balsamic together over medium-high heat in a large sauce pan, about 5 minutes."
- "Toast walnuts in a small skillet; set aside to cool."
- "Pule greens on platter."
- "Stir mustard into balsamic-honey dressing, then whisk in about 1 cup extra virgin olive oil; pour over greens."

<i>Before you jump to The Ultimate Beef Wellington recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family ought to start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electrical power and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically efficient when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's concerning being functional, usually.
