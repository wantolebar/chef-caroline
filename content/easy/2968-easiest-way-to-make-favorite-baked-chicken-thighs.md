<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to operate as often.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it really is basically using common sense.
