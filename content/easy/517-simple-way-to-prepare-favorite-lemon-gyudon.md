<i>Before you jump to Lemon Gyudon recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
