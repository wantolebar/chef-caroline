<i>Before you jump to Chicken gizzards stewed in sour cream recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Start with changing the bulbs. Accomplish this for your house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them rather than incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. Along with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and see exactly how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that hard. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
