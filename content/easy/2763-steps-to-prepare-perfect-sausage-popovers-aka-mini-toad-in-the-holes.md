recipeingredient:
- "1 cup all purpose plain flour"
- "1 large egg"
- "2 cup milk"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "6 pork link sausages"
- "6 tbsp vegetable oil lard or beef drippings"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, add the flour and make a well in the middle with a spoon. Break the egg into there."
- "Add the salt and begin to whisk the egg into the flour. As this gets a bit stiff, start to add the milk as you whisk until you have a batter."
- "Leave the batter aside to rest while you make the sausage balls..."
- "Take kitchen scissors and snip each sausage into two peices. Remove the skins and shape each piece into a ball."
- "Pour half a tablespoon of oil or fat into each hole in a twelve hole muffin tin and put it into an oven heated to 400C. It&#39;s a good idea to place a baking tray on the shelf below to catch any dripping fat."
- "Spray a frying pan with cooking spray and put on a medium heat. Add the sausage balls and brown them on all sides (this should take 8-9 minutes)"
- "The oil in the muffin tin will be very hot by now, so be careful doing the next step. Put the sausage balls into the muffin tin, one into each hole, then quickly pour a quarter cup of batter over each one, doing so as quickly as you can to keep the oil hot. Some people take the tin out of the oven onto the hot hob to do this, others just keep the tin in the oven and add the sausage and batter carefully while it&#39;s half in there."
- "Cook them for 15-20 minutes, or until golden, puffed and crisp."

<i>Before you jump to Sausage Popovers (aka Mini Toad-in-the-Holes) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. When our work day is finished, most people do not want to go to the gym. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. With training you can get all of the nutrients and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Climb stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a extremely high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is totally do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the upper floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will decide to be idle and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are a whole lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't forget that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You really want your body to be powerful too.
