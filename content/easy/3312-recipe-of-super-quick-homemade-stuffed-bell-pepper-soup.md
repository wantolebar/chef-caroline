Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you may look for more ways to use the microwave.

Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

From the above it ought to be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite straightforward to live green, all things considered. A lot of it truly is merely utilizing common sense.
