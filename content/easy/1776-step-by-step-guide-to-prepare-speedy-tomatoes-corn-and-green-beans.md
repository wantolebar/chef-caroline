It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Maybe the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. When you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is definitely not true. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Environmentally friendly living is not that difficult. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
