<i>Before you jump to Stuffed Bell Pepper recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Let us begin with something really easy, changing the actual light bulbs. Accomplish this for your house, not just the kitchen. You really need to upgrade your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the extras is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will probably end up at a landfill site. It goes further than simply replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off unless you absolutely need them, and notice just how much electricity you can save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, after all. A lot of it really is basically making use of common sense.
