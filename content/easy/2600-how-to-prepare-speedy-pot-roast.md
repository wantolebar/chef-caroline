It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and maybe this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Save even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. A lot of it truly is basically utilizing common sense.
