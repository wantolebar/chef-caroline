recipeinstructions:
- "To prepare the crumble, put the chilled butter in a bowl, and using a fork or a dough cutter, chop into tiny pieces. Sift in the ★ ingredients."
- "Use your fingers to work the butter into the dry ingredients to make the crumble, taking care not to form large clumps. Add the nuts."
- "Feel free to use your choice of nuts. I use 35 g of a blend of chopped walnuts, almond slices, and cashew nuts."
- "Wrap the crumble in plastic wrap, then chill in the refrigerator to harden. That completes the preparation of the crumble."
- "To prepare the caramelized apple, roughly chop the apple into 4 cm chunks. Put the chopped apple and sugar into a sauce pan and heat over medium-high heat."
- "Once the apple starts to become shiny and the juice is cooked out, stir in the butter. When the apples absorb the butter, transfer to a bowl or tray to cool."
- "To make the muffin batter, microwave the butter to soften. Keep your eye to make sure it doesn&#39;t melt. (Or, you can bring it to room temperature in advance.)"
- "Put the softened butter in a bowl, then thoroughly beat it with a whisk until creamy. Add the honey and mix well."
- "Next, add the yogurt and whisk. It will separate, but don&#39;t worry. Then, break in the egg, and thoroughly mix. It will also separate, but that is no need for concern."
- "Preheat the oven to 170℃."
- "Sift the ☆ ingredients into the batter. Use a whisk to mix until lumps are gone and it is completely smooth. Do not over mix."
- "The caramelized apples should have cooled by Steps 9-11. Add the syrupy liquid from the apples to the batter, and stir it in."
- "The batter is complete. Fill the muffin cups 50-60% full with the batter, then pack in the apples."
- "Remove the crumble from the refrigerator, then using your fingers, crumble on top of each muffin, pressing down very gently as you go."
- "The crumble will stick to the muffins as they bake, and will not fall out. There&#39;s no need to pack the crumble into the batter."
- "Bake for about 30 minutes in 170℃ preheated oven. They&#39;re done when a skewer inserted comes out clean."
- "There you have a crunchy and aromatic muffin with sweet apples and a moist inside. They&#39;re pleasingly delightful muffins and a perfect complement to a strong cup of coffee."
- "I recommend cooling completely before eating for a better textured crumble, and overall better flavor."

<i>Before you jump to Cinnamon Nut Crumble Apple Muffins recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Every person knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be irritating. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some of the best techniques to be healthy.

Water is the most effective drinks out there. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every now and then isn’t a horrible idea. Getting all of your hydration from them is a terrible idea. When you decide on water more than other beverages you are helping your body remain very healthy and hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories out of your diet— without having to be forced to eat terrible tasting diet food. Water is often the key to successful weight loss and healthfulness.

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get wholesome. An costly gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done each day, can do plenty to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. You need to help make your body as strong you can make it.
