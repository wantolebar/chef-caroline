<i>Before you jump to Marble cake #baking contest recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the ecosystem. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. Each and every family ought to start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is actually greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses much more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is going. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes as an alternative to heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
