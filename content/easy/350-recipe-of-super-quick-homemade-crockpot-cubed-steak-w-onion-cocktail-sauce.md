Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use a great deal less energy, by using countertop appliances. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that difficult. A lot of it really is merely making use of common sense.
