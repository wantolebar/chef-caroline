<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as economically as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. The correct temperature for food is 37F inside the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to run less frequently, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that difficult. It's concerning being functional, most of the time.
