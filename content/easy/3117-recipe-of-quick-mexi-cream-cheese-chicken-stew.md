<i>Before you jump to Mexi Cream Cheese Chicken Stew recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These kinds of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of energy is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
