- " garlic minced"
- " brandy"

recipeinstructions:
- "Bloom the dried mushrooms in 2 cups warm water for 20 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and give them a quick rinse. Chop any large pieces into bite-sized chunks. Strain the blooming water (now mushroom broth) through a coffee filter to remove any sediment, and set it aside."
- "Melt 1 tbsp butter in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add all the mushrooms. Fry until the water the mushrooms give off evaporates and they take on a bit of golden colour. This should take about 10 minutes."
- "Stir the shallots and garlic into the pot and continue frying 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. Pour in the brandy. Let cook until most of the brandy has been absorbed, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour and stir for 1 minute to coat."
- "Add the thyme, mushroom broth, chicken stock, and 2 cups cold water to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes."
- "Fish the thyme sprigs out of the pot. Break the cambozola into chunks and add it a little at a time to the pot, stirring to melt it in. Remove any big pieces of mold that float to the top; they&#39;ll turn rubbery. When all the cheese has melted, turn off the heat and stir in the cream to finish."

<i>Before you jump to Cambozola and Mushroom Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You should be glad to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super difficult. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Choose water over other products. Soda and coffee, when consumed in small amounts, aren't that bad. It will be, however, a bad idea to exclusively drink soda or coffee. Drinking water instead of other forms of drinks is a good way to help your body in its health and hydration. Doing this helps you cut hundreds of calories out of your diet without your having to suffer through a bunch of gross diet food. Water is often the key to successful weight reduction and healthfulness.

There are a lot of things that work toward your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to enable you to get healthy and lose pounds. Make sensible choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. You need your body to be powerful too.
