Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Maybe the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Maybe the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it relates to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you make certain the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. A lot of it is simply utilizing common sense.
