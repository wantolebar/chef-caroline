<i>Before you jump to Tabouli /Tabbouleh recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Let's begin with something not that hard, changing the actual light bulbs. Do this for the whole house, not merely the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you will need to use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This also takes place in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Efficient living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
