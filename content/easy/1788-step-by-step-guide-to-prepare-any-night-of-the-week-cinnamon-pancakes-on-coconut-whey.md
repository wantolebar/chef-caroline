<i>Before you jump to Cinnamon pancakes on coconut whey recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electrical power is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
