<i>Before you jump to Chocolate Muffins recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly when they are not operating as effectively as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electrical power. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that hard. A lot of it is basically using common sense.
