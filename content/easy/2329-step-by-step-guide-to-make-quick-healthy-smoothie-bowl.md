<i>Before you jump to Healthy Smoothie bowl recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your cooking area more green.

You may prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is started. Conserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. Typically, all it will take is a little common sense.
