recipeinstructions:
- "Cut chicken into small bite-sized pieces, place in large baking tray, add Tandoori Mix, mix thoroughly, cover with foil and refrigerate overnight."
- "Once the Tandoori chicken has marinated overnight, place the baking tray (foil on) in a preheated to 350°F convection oven. Bake for about 15 to 20 minutes until the chicken releases a decent amount of juice."
- "Place a large cooking pot on a stove set to medium-high heat. Pour in canola oil, and add in onions, ginger, and garlic once the oil is hot. Stir occasionally and keep the pot covered until the onions turn translucent."

- "Stir the mixture for a few minutes, and then pour it out of the pot into a blender and blend until it turns into a creamy paste. Pour the paste back into the pot, keeping the pot on low heat. Use a spoon or spatula to scoop out as much of the sauce as possible from the blender. Do not rinse the blender just yet."
- "Add the bay leaves to the cooking pot."
- "Take the Tandoori chicken from step 2, and add it, including all the juices, into the cooking pot, and mix thoroughly."
- "Add cashew nuts into the unwashed blender, along with 1/2 cup of water, and a few pinches of salt. Blend until the mixture turns milky."
- "Gently pour the cashew mix into the saucepan, and stir."
- "Add in fenugreek leaves, and stir some more. Let it summer for 5 to 10 minutes before turning off stove. Serve with warm basmati rice, naan, or parathas. For even better results, refrigerate overnight, and serve the next day."
