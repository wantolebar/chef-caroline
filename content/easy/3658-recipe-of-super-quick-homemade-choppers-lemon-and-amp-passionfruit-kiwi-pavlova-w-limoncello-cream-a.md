recipeinstructions:
- "First, to make the creme patisierre."

- "Add the flour and beat on high speed for a further 2 minutes. Set aside."
- "Pour milk in a heavy-based saucepan adding in the chopped up vanilla beans. bring this to just below the boil."
- "Remove the vanilla bean bits and, whisking vigourously while pouring, pour the milk into the egg mixture and continue whisking fast for 1 minute."
- "Return this mixture to the saucepan back on a medium heat and stir continuously until the mixture thickens. about 2 or so minutes."
- "Pour into a bowl and cover with gladwrap (ceram wrap), making sure the wrap lays across the the top of the patisierre to stop a film from forming."
- "Cool completely on the bench."
- "When cool, stir in the Lemon Curd and the Passionfruit Pulp (I include the seeds as I like the texture change in the Pav, but you can seive these out if you wish)."
- "Place the Pastisierre into a ziplock plastic bag, remove as much air as you can, zip it up and keep at room tempetature while you prepare the Pav. (If you don&#39;t want to make the Pav right away, the patissierre will stay ok in the bag in the cupboard for at least 3 - 4 days)"

- "Place baking paper on an oven tray and draw a 25cm circle."
- "Scoop out half of the Pav mixture onto the tray and then put the creme patisierre made earlier into a piping bag (or snip the end of the ziplock bag and use that) and pipe swirls of the patisierre onto the Pav, avoiding the very edges. Then scoop on top the remaining Pav mixture. Using a spatula, shape out a circle leaving about a 1cm gap to the edge of the drawn circle."
- "Smooth the top of the Pav and then put in the oven and immediately turn down the heat to 215°F."
- "Bake Pavlova for 1 hour and 15 minutes then TURN OVEN OFF AND LEAVE PAV IN THERE WITH DOOR SLIGHTLY OPEN TO COOL COMPLETELY"
- "Carefully lift Pav onto a serving plate or platter and top with whipped cream that has the Limoncello and the remaining patisierre folded through it."

<i>Before you jump to Choppers Lemon &amp; Passionfruit Kiwi Pavlova w/ Limoncello cream a recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be sensible and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle demands. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Pick water over other drinks. Drinking a soda or cup of coffee once in awhile won't hurt you too badly. Getting most of your hydration from them is a awful idea. Choosing water as an alternative to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories out of your diet— without having to be forced to eat terrible tasting diet food. Effective weight loss efforts often depend solely on water intake.

There are a whole lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Not all of them necessitate fancy gym memberships or limited diets. Little things, when done every day, can do a great deal to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A good amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. You need to help to make your body as strong as possible.
