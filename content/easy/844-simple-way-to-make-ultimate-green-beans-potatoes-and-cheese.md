Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. One more way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to go as often.

From the above it ought to be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite easy to live green, after all. It's concerning being practical, usually.
