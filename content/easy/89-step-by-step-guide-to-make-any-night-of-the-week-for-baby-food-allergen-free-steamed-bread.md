<i>Before you jump to For Baby Food - Allergen-Free Steamed Bread recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is started. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that hard. It's about being sensible, most of the time.
