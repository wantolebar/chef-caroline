- "6 medium russet potatoes"
- "1 big yellow onion"
- "1 Ham Steak"
- "2-3 eggs optional"
- " Milk"
- " Lots of salt"
- " Pepper"
- " Lots of flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Here we go. Read the WHOLE recipe and gather your ingredients."
- "Peel and cut potatoes into 1/2” cubes"
- "Put in big pot and just cover with water. Cook until partially tender."
- "While potatoes are cooking Chop onions and ham steak. And sauté in separate pan until onions are translucent. Set aside."
- "When potatoes are semi-done add milk. You add 1/2 as much milk as there is water. It loooooooks like a lot. And it is."
- "Add salt and pepper. Lots. Really. You will probably need to add more later too."
- "Add cooked onions and ham. Bring to low boil."
- "While waiting for it to boil make rivlets aka dumplings. The soup is not the same without them so don’t skip this step."
- "Make rivlets by whisking 2 eggs together and then adding flour. So start with 100 grams and then keeping adding flour until the mixture comes together. It’s not too wet or too dry. I know those are awful directions but that’s what we do. As a rule it’s 100 grams of flour per egg but use your best judgement. I don’t really think you can screw them up."
- "Once the soup is boiling add rivlets by using the two teaspoon method. Put some dough on a teaspoon and slide it off into the soup with the other teaspoon. Not too big. They should be about the size of a big marble."
- "Cook for about ten minutes until the rivlets are cooked through. The soup should start getting thicker now because the rivlets start absorbing the broth."
- "Taste and add salt and pepper if needed. It should have a bit of peppery flavor."
- "If you want the soup thicker then thicken with a flour slurry."
- "We add cheese and scallions on the top of the bowl when eating."
- "Good luck and tell me how it goes. Remember be happy while your cooking and it’ll make your food taste better."

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A large amount of electricity is actually consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electricity and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. Checking that the condenser is clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less frequently, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite straightforward to live green, of course. It's related to being practical, usually.
