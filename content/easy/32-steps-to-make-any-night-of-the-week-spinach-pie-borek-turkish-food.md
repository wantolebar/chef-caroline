<i>Before you jump to Spinach Pie - Börek (Turkish Food) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the specialists, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These types of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Start out with exchanging the lights. This will certainly go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would certainly keep a great deal of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. Together with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights especially are often left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house as well. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off whenever you don't need them.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty straightforward to live green, after all. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
