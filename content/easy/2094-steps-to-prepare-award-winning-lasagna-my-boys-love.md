- "300 g pork mince"
- "2 stalks celery"
- "1 large carrot"
- "2 small red onions"
- "2 tablespoons vegetable oil"
- " Pork gravy granules"
- " Garlic in a squeeze tube 2 tsp"

recipeinstructions:
- "Dice the carrot, celery and red onion. Saute them in the oil for 5 mins. Add the garlic, tomato paste and sage. When softened add the pork mince to brown."
- "Put the oven on to 220° to heat up whilst you prepare the other parts."
- "When the mince is brown add the pasata and bring to the boil. Then turn down to a low slow simmer for about 25 mins."
- "In a separate pan- snip the bacon in and fry it off. Then add the spinach to wilt in the pan and coat in the bacon fat. Once its wilted let it cool a little and mix it in a bowl with the ricotta and a couple of spoons of grated parmesan."
- "Then in a third pan melt the butter and stir in the flour. Cook the roux for a few minutes and whisk in the milk to make a bechamel. Season this with black pepper and nutmeg. Keep stirring until it thickens."

Then more meat sauce and a final layer of pasta. Pour the bechamel on top and lift it into the oven (the tray catches any stray bits that bubble up and stops it dripping down to the oven floor to burn and give you a nasty oven to clean)."
- "Keep it baking for about 30 mins then lift it out. Sprinkle over grated cheddar and put back in for another 15 mins."
- "Serve alone or with a crisp salad. The day wasn&#39;t so bad after all."

<i>Before you jump to Lasagna my boys love recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Lowering costs Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These kinds of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. Perhaps the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. In comparison with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many individuals incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. Especially if you ensure that the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. By cool drying or even air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

The kitchen by itself provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it truly is basically utilizing common sense.
