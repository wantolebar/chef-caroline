recipeingredient:
- "2   1/2 Cups Flour"
- "1 Teaspoon Sugar"
- "1 Cup butter Very   cold      cubed"
- "7 Tablespoons butter Ice cold"
- "3 Cups Blueberries"
- "1 Tablespoon Thyme Fresh"
- "1/2 Cup Sugar"
- "2 Tablespoons Corn starch"
- "1/2 Lemon  juiced"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a food processor, add the flour, salt and sugar. Pulse once to mix through. Add the pieces of butter to the flour and pulse in the food processor a few time until the mixture looks like little &#34;peas&#34;."
- "Add ice cold water to the flour mixture, a few tablespoons at a time until the dough gets wet and its able to &#34;stick&#34; together. I added about 7-8 tablespoons of cold water. It can also look like wet send when you squeeze it together with your hands."
- "Place dough on a clean surface and form into a large ball. Cut ball in half and form into round disks. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and chill in fridge or at least an hour."
- "To make the pie mixture, in a large bowl, add the blueberries, sugar, lemon zest and juice, thyme and corn starch. Toss together with a spoon so everything is coated evenly."
- "Take one of the dough discs and roll it out on a floured surface until it is about 1/8 thick. Then use an 8in round cutter (or a bowl, like I did) and cut out 8 inch circles."
- "Place one of the circles into the jar, pressing the bottom down and the sides up and over the edge. Just make sure to not pull the dough, just press it in."
- "Then fill the jar generously with the blueberry mixture."
- "Use the other dough circle for the top of the pie. You can either cut it into strips and create a lattice look or place the whole thing on top, crimp the edges and cut small slits on the top."
- "Brush the tops with egg wash using a pastry brush and sprinkle with sugar."
- "Place all jars on a cookie sheet and bake in 350 degree oven for 35 minutes and then cover with tin foil and continue baking for another 10-15 minutes, until the tops are golden brown and the fruit is bubbly."
- "When done, be very careful because the glass jars are very hot! Allow to cool for at least 20 minutes."

<i>Before you jump to Blueberry Thyme Pie in a Jar recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electrical power is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all perform, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
