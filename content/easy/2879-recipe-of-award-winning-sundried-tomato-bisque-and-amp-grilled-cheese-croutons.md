recipeingredient:
- " Bisque"
- "1/4 cup Olive Oil"
- "2 tsp Minced Garlic"
- "1/2 cup Red Onion"
- "1/3 cup Sundried Tomatoes"
- "28 oz Diced Tomatoes"
- "2 cup Tomato Juice"
- "4 dash Dried Basil"
- "2 tbsp Rice Vinegar"
- "2 tbsp Sugar"
- "2 each Basil Leafs"
- "1 cup Heavy Cream"
- "2/3 box Philadelphia Cream Cheese"
- " Grilled Cheese Croutons"
- "4 slice Bread of Choice"
- "4 slice Cheese of Choice"
- "4 tbsp Butter"
- "4 each Basil Leaves"
- "1 tbsp Olive Oil"
- "1 dash Balsamic VinegarGlaze"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a 5 qt. pot heat olive oil on medium heat, add diced red onions, sauté for about 3 min. Add garlic and sundried tomatoes, sauté for another 3 minutes. Control heat depending on your stove. Heat may be turned down to ensure the onions and garlic don&#39;t burn."
- "Add diced tomatoes, tomato juice, basil, rice vinegar, &amp; sugar. Stew on med/low heat for about 10 min. (Stir regularly)"
- "Julienne or chop fresh basil leafs. Add to pot and continue stewing for 10 more minutes (stir regularly)."
- "While tomatoes and seasonings are stewing begin to prep to make the grilled cheese croutons. Gather all of the recommended ingredients. ** I will note that I find, the more dense the bread, the better crouton it makes. **"
- "Butter one side of each piece of bread. Turn the bread over so the unbuttered side is exposed. Add two slices of desired cheese to two pieces of the unbuttered side ( you can use shredded cheese, I find that sliced cheese is easier to maintain). Take the other two slices of bread (one of each) place the unbuttered side on top of the two pieces that have cheese already on them. This should expose the butter on the outsides of each of the bread slices."
- "Go back to the stew and add heavy cream. Chop 2/3 of the cream cheese block into chunks (this helps the cream cheese to melt faster) add to the pot. Simmer until the cream cheese has melted. Approx. 5-7 min. Stir in the meantime. ***I will note: the better quality cream cheese the better consultancy you will have! Generic/cheap brands tend to separate faster. I will also mention, if you feel the bisque is too thick for your liking you can always add more tomato juice. This will thin out the consistency making more of a soup."
- "Once cream cheese chunks have melted, use a hand blender to purée ingredients. Do this until all of the tomato chunks have liquified. This will also help if any cream cheese did not fully melt. Keep on low heat until ready to serve."
- "Heat a sauté pan on medium/low heat for a couple of minutes. After the pan is hot, add buttered cheese sandwiches. You may need to turn heat down to low depending on your stove. Watch for the bread to get golden brown and still slowly melt the cheese in the middle. After one side is golden brown and crisp, flip sandwiches over to cook the other side. Watch carefully for the other side to get golden and crispy as well. Once both sides are crisp, move to a side plate."
- "Take your newly grilled cheese and cut them into cubes."
- "Julienne/Cut more fresh basil."
- "Serve the Tomato Bisque into desired bowl. Add grilled cheese cubes (croutons) on top of the bisque. Drizzle a bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Top off with fresh basil and serve!"

<i>Before you jump to Sundried Tomato Bisque &amp; Grilled Cheese Croutons recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

While it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. If you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, nonetheless that is certainly not true. Particularly if you ensure that the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, of course. Typically, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
