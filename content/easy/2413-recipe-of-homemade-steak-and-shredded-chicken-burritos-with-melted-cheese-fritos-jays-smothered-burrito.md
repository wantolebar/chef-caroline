It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electricity is consumed by freezers and also refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, coupled with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to operate as often.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
