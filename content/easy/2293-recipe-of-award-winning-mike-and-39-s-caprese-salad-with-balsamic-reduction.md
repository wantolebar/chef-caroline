- "1 (16 oz) Quality Mozterella Cheese"
- "1 Quality Bottle Balsamic Vinegar"
- "1 package Fresh Basil Leaves or 12 cup from your garden"
- "2 LG Extra Firm Beefeater Tomatoes"
- "1 tsp Sea Salt divided"
recipeinstructions:

- "Construct your salads."
- "Lightly drizzle your olive oil and Balsamic Vinegar on top your salad. Sprinkle salad with sea salt."
- "Serve chilled as an antipasto. [a starter or appetizer]"
- "REDUCTION INSTRUCTIONS  In a small, nonreactive pan, add your balsamic vinegar and any other herbs you prefer.  Turn your kitchen fan on and open a window as the vinegar fumes will waft throughout your home.   Bring vinegar to a simmer over medium-high heat, then turn down heat to keep it at a low simmer. This process will take about 10 - 15 minutes to thicken up and reduce. Watch very closely at the end as you don&#39;t want to burn your reduction. When it coats a spoon, you&#39;ll know it&#39;s completed.   Your sauce will thicken up considerably once it has cooled. You can make it less thick or, make it as thick as molasses. Anything more will result in burning. To thin once cooled, gently reheat and add a little water as needed."

Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym.

If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required nutrients and exercise. Here are some hints to be as healthy as possible.

When you go to the grocery store, be smart about it. Making good decisions when buying food means that you'll be able to eat nutritious meals without a lot of effort. At the conclusion of your day do you really want to deal with packed grocery stores and long waits in the drive through line? You want to get home immediately and eat something beneficial. Fill your pantry shelves with wholesome foods. This way—even if you pick out something a little greasy or not as good for you as it could be, you’re still choosing foods that are better for you than you would get at the local diner or fast food drive through window.

There are plenty of things you can pursue to become healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restrained diets. Little things, when done every single day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent about the decisions you make each day is a start.
