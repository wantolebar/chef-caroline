recipeingredient:
- "1 1214 lb Fresh Turkey"
- " Brine"
- "1 qt (32 oz) Vegetable Stock"
- "1 (750 ml) bottle Pinot Grigio wine"
- "2 large shallots sliced thin"
- "6-7 cloves garlic smashed but not peeled"
- "2 lemons cut in half and squeezed halfway"
- "7-8 sprigs fresh thyme"
- "6 whole bay leaves"
- "1 1/4 cup kosher salt"
- "2 tbs whole peppercorns"
- "1 tbs whole mustard seed"
- " Water to cover"
- " Butter Compound"
- "1 cup unsalted butter"
- "2 tbs kosher salt"
- "1 tsp fresh ground pepper"
- "1 tsp garlic powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove Turkey from packaging. Wash with cold water to remove all juices. Set aside."
- "Assemble and prepare the remaining ingredients as noted."
- "In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable stock, salt, bay leaves, peppercorns, and mustard seeds to a boil. Stir until salt is dissolved. Cool to room temperature."
- "Once cooled, pour the brine into a 5-gallonstock pot or container. Pour in the bottle of wine, then add the shallots, garlic, thyme, and lemons. Slowly lower in the turkey (otherwise it will slosh out all over your countertop!)"
- "Add ice and water to cover the turkey and either set in your refrigerator or continue adding ice to keep it below 40Â°. Keep the turkey in the brine for at least 24 hours."
- "After 24 hours, remove turkey and drain all liquid and remove any pepper corns or mustard seeds from within the carcass. With paper towels, dry the outer areas of the turkey. Let sit at room temperature for at least an hour."
- "In the meantime, soften your butter (not to melting) and incorporate the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Wrap in Saran Wrap and place in refrigerator for about the same time youâ€™re waiting for the turkey to adjust to room temp."
- "Now go outside and prepare your smoker. For any poultry, youâ€™ll want to use either Pecan or Apple wood as your smoke base. (for this specific turkey I used pecan.)"
- "While your smoker is heating, go back inside and remove the turkey and butter from the refrigerator. Separate the skin on turkey breast and thighs. In the cavities, insert the butter mixture liberally. (Seriously, you canâ€™t add too much!)"
- "Place an aluminum drip pan on the heat deflector in your smoker to catch the drippings (there will be a lot and if you donâ€™t use a drip pan it will eventually extinguish your fire before the turkey is done.) Place the turkey on the top placement on your smoker. Bring your smoker to a steady 225Â°. *Oh, quickly wrap the tips of your wings in foil or they will burn!"
- "After 3 hours, open and baste the turkey with the drippings and each hour afterward. *As a rule, at 225Â°, you should plan cooking time at 30 mins per pound."
- "When youâ€™ve reached the appropriate time based on the weight of your turkey, remove from smoker."
- "Here is the most important step to keep your smoked turkey moist and tender: prepare a roasting pan to just accommodate the size of your turkey. Add whatever drippings are remaining from the dripping pan to the roasting pan with the turkey. Next, place that pan into a roaster or another larger pan (with a cover) with water creating indirect moist heat at about 250-275Â° depending on the size of your turkey. If larger, then make it 275. Keep in that roaster for at least 3-4 hours."
- "Finally, remove and carve like youâ€™re a professional!! ENJOY!!"

<i>Before you jump to The Most Amazingly Moist Smoked Turkey! ðŸ¦ƒ recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is complete, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesnâ€™t have to be irritating. If you keep at it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

When you go grocery shopping, be sensible about it. If you make smart choices when you are buying your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think for a second: you don't want to go to a busy grocery store or sit in a long line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to go home and make something from your kitchen. Make sure that what you have at home is healthy. This makes it effortless to have a great meal--even if you want something junky--because you'll be eating something that is obviously better for you than anything you'd buy in a hurry at the store or in the fast food joint.

There are lots of things you can go after to become healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do small things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. Trying to get in as much exercise as possible is another. Don't overlook that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. Itâ€™s about making your body as powerful as it can be.
