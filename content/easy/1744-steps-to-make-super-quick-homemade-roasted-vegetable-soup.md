That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around.

This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Efficient living is something we can all perform, without difficulty. It's concerning being functional, more often than not.
