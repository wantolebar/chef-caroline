<i>Before you jump to Thai style ~ red curry veggie sauté recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as economically as they should. You can save up to 60% on energy whenever you get a new one, in comparison to those from longer than ten years ago. Keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite easy to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it takes is a little common sense.
