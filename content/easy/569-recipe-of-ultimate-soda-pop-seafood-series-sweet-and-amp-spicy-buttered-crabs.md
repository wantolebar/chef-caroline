<i>Before you jump to Soda Pop Seafood Series - Sweet &amp; Spicy Buttered Crabs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared obligation we have for turning things around. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Probably the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially economical when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Save even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living just isn't that hard. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
