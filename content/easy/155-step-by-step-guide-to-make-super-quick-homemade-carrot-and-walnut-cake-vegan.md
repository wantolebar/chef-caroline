Choosing water instead of other beverage adds to your body's health and allows it stay hydrated. Youâ€™re also cutting hundreds of calories from your dietâ€” without having to resort to terrible tasting diet food.

It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being intelligent about the choices you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your lifestyle choices.
