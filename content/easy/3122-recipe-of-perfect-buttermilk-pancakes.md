<i>Before you jump to Buttermilk pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. That has completely changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Even though it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the greatest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes rather than heat drying them.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. Typically, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
