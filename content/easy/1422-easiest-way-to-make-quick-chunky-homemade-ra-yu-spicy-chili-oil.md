<i>Before you jump to Chunky Homemade Ra-yu Spicy Chili Oil recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not running as efficiently as they should. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that tough. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
