<i>Before you jump to Strawberry banana smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

You may well prefer preparing food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many men and women wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses less energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is especially effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
