<i>Before you jump to Spicy Southwest Style Chicken Strips recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. In case you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that are more than ten years old. The suitable temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to run less regularly, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. Mostly, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
