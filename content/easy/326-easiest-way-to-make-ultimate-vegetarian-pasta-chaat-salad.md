<i>Before you jump to Vegetarian Pasta Chaat/Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everyone knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required foods and activites. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Run the stairs. Walk up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get off of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are many things you can do to become healthy. Extensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose on a daily basis that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being clever when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. Trying to get in as much physical activity as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about just how much you weigh. You need your body to be powerful too.
