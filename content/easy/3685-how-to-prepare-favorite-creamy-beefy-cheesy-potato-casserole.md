<i>Before you jump to Creamy, Beefy, Cheesy Potato Casserole recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. These changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going more green.

Let's begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a small amount more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. It goes further than just replacing the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The family spends major time in the cooking area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it happens in other parts of the house at the same time. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and discover how much electricity you can save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not really that hard. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
