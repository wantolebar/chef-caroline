recipeinstructions:
- "Step 1: Brine. Place the chicken in a large bowl add water salt and some vinegar. What this step does is plump the chicken, makes it juicier. Time: Minimum 1 hour. I kept it for almost 3 hours."
- "Step 2: Clean and Gash. Drain the brine chicken and wash it with clean water. Pat dry and put gashes on the chicken. This will help the masla to go deep."
- "Step 3: Marinate. Marinate the chicken with the marinate ingredients above and mix well. Light up the charcoal piece and place it in a dish made out of foil and add ghee to it, immediately covering it. This process is to infuse tandoori flavor."
- "Step 4: Kadhai Masala Mix: Roast the dry whole kadhai spice mix on a low flame. The idea is to roast the spice mix till the aroma of the roasted spices fill up your senses. They should be light brown in colour. Once the mix cools down, ground it coarsely as shown. I used a grinder, you can use the mortar and pestel."
- "Step 5: Cook. Put a thick bottomed large pan on the stove and add the whole spice mix to the pan. After 2 3 minutes of roasting add 2 tbsp of ghee and let the spices sizzle. Once the spices sizzle add 0.5 tbsp of cooking oil(I used rice bran). Add onions."

- "Step 7: Add 1 tsp Ginger garlic paste to the onions. Cook now for 4 -5 minutes. Add turmeric powder now. And 3 slit green chillis."
- "Step 8: Now add tomatoes (200 gms). I used half a tomato can into the pan. Now add salt to taste to the pan and cook really well. The colour should be really intense and dark. It took me 20 minutes of cooking the tomatoes till the oil seperated."
- "Step 8.5: Pre heat the oven at Max. While tomatoes are cooking and are half way through add your marinated chicken to the oven grill. I grilled at Max for 10 minutes."
- "Step 9: Add dry spice and half of kadai chicken spice mix to the tomatoes. Cook for 7-8 minutes and add grilled chicken to it and on high flame mix the chicken and the gravy in the pan. Add the Jus on the grill tray to the pan as well. Cook for 5 - 7 minutes on medium flame and now add cubed onions and capsicum with the remaining kadhai mix masala."
- "Step 10: Cook the chicken for another 15 minutes with cover on pot. You can add water to make it with gravy. I did not because I like my Kadhai chicken with thick gravy. In the end add kastoori methi and 1 tbsp cooking cream. Stop cooking and mix well."
- "Step 11: Serve with chopped coriander."

<i>Before you jump to Kadhai Chicken Indian Restaurant Style recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen area more green.

Start with changing the bulbs. This will certainly go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. Using these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the actual benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The family spends major time in the cooking area, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen alone gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite straightforward to live green, after all. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
