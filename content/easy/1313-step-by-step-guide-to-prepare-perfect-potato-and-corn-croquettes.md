<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Maybe the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. Many individuals wrongly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the highest energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty straightforward to live green, all things considered. Mostly, all it requires is a little common sense.
