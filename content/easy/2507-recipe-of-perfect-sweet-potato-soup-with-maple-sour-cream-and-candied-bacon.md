<i>Before you jump to Sweet Potato Soup With Maple Sour Cream and Candied Bacon recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen more green.

Start out with replacing the light bulbs. Do this for the whole house, not merely the kitchen. You should change your incandescent lights along with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a small amount more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. You also have to acquire the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not limited to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off as soon as you don't need them.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty straightforward to live green, of course. It's about being functional, usually.
