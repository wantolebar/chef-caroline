recipeingredient:
- " Marinade "
- "1/3 cup olive oil"
- " Juice from 12 lemon"
- "1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar"
- "2 tsp. dijon mustard"
- "1 tsp. Italian seasoning"
- "1 tsp. garlic powder"
- "1 tsp. paprika"
- "1/2 tsp. dried crushed rosemary"
- "1/2 tsp. dried thyme leaves"
- "1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper optional"
- "To taste salt and pepper"
- " The Rest "
- "1 lb. chicken cut of choice"
- "1 lb baby red potatoes"
- "1 lb baby dutch yellow potatoes"
- "4 large carrots"
- "4 large cloves garlic unpeeled optional"
- " Fresh parmesan cheese optional for topping"
recipeinstructions:
- "The first thing to do, which you&#39;ll want to do a bit in advance is to whisk together all the marinade ingredients in a small bowl or a measuring cup. Set aside about half of it to season the veggies with. Then place the chicken either in a large, shallow bowl or a gallon sized Ziploc bag and pour the rest of the marinade over the top of it. Coat the chicken really well, then cover the bowl and set it in the fridge to marinate for at least 30 or so minutes."
- "Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a large baking tray or roasting pan with foil and grease it. Set it aside."
- "While the chicken marinates, you can begin prepping your veggies. I just chop the potatoes in half if they&#39;re small, in quarters if they&#39;re on the bigger side. Then peel and chop the carrots into larger, diagonal pieces. Leave the garlic as whole, unpeeled cloves. Toss all of the veggies, except for the garlic, with the set aside marinade."
- "Take the chicken out of the marinade and set it onto the prepared baking tray. Arrange all of the veggies around and between the chicken. Just place the garlic in different spots nestled into the veggies."
- "Bake for about 35-45 or so minutes, or until the veggies are fork tender and the chicken is at an internal temperature of 165°F. Remove it from the oven and grate some parmesan cheese over the top of it all (optional but delicious)."
- "Serve immediately and enjoy! Refrigerate any leftovers."

<i>Before you jump to One Pan Chicken and Veggies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. A hot, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a pain. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some ideas to be as healthy as possible.

Choose water over other products. Having a soda or a cup of coffee every occasionally isn’t a bad idea. Using them for your only source of hydration, however, is dumb. Choosing water as an alternative to other beverage adds to your body's health and helps it stay hydrated. You’re also cutting hundreds of calories out of your diet— without having to deal with terrible tasting diet food. Water is often the key to successful weight reduction and healthfulness.

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the selections you make each day is a start. Getting as much exercise as possible is another factor. The numbers on the scale aren't the only signal of your healthfulness. It’s about making your body as strong as it can be.
