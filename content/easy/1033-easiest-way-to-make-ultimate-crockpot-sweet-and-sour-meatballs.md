<i>Before you jump to Crockpot Sweet and Sour Meatballs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more environmentally friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

You may well prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances will boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned manner, but you would be wrong. Particularly if you make sure the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, use the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
