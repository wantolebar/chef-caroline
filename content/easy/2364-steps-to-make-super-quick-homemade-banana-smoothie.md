<i>Before you jump to Banana Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And also Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, especially if they are not operating as efficiently as they should. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Another way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, due to the fact that the motor won't have to go as often.

The kitchen alone gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, of course. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
