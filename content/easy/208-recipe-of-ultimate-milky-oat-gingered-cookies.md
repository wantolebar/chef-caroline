<i>Before you jump to Milky-oat gingered Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers along with hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to start saving energy by going more green.

A lot of electricity is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. Typically, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
