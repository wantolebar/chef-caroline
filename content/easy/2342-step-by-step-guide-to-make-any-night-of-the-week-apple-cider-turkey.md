recipeingredient:
- "1 1214 lb turkey"
- " Brine"
- "2 gallons apple cider"
- "2 cups kosher salt"
- "1 cup brown sugar"
- "10 cloves garlic"
- "1 handful sliced fresh ginger"
- "4 oranges quartered"
- "4 whole cloves"
- "2 tbsp crushed red pepper flakes"
- "1-2 gallons water"
- " Cavity Filler"
- "1 apple cut into 8 pieces"
- "1 lemon cut into 8 pieces"
- "4 sprigs fresh tarragon"
- "4 sprigs fresh rosemary"
- "5 sprigs fresh thyme"
- "5 sprigs fresh Italian flat leaf parsley"
- " Pan"
- "4 apples quartered"
- "4 stocks of celery"
- "1/4 large sweet onion"
- "12 oz hard apple cider"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put 1/2 gallon of apple cider, salt and sugar into a large pan. Heat and stir until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Now mix all brine ingredients into a food safe bucket. Submerge the turkey completely and let brine for a minimum of 8 hours, 12 to 24 is best."
- "Once brined pat dry and let rest while preparing the pan for roasting. The skin has started to take on a little color from the brine."
- "Preheat oven to 350째"
- "If using a disposable foil roasting pan place it onto a baking sheet for additional support. Spread out the ingredients for the pan in an even layer."
- "Stuff and truss the turkey. Trussing not just helps the turkey cook evenly but also simply helps keep the cavity ingredients inside. Get the turkey into the pan and pour in the hard apple cider. All the pan ingredients add great flavor and create an amazing base for gravy."
- "Roast for an hour and a half breast side down. This helps keep the breast meat moist."
- "Now flip over and cook until the breast meat is 165째. Baste with the pan juices every half hour or so. This is my new favorite turkey, I will be making this a few times a year at least!!!"

<i>Before you jump to Apple Cider Turkey recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not running efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The correct temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use less electricity. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that tough. A lot of it is basically making use of common sense.
