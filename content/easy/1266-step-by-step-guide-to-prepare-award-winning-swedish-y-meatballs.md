recipeingredient:
- "1 lb ground beef and pork mix"
- "1 egg"
- "4 slices bread"
- "1 large shallot minced"
- "3 tbsp chopped fresh dill"
- "1 tsp ground nutmeg"
- "2 cups beef stock"
- "1 tbsp cornstarch"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the bread slices in a bowl with 1 cup of water. Let soak a few minutes, then remove the bread and squeeze out as much liquid as you can from them."
- "To a large mixing bowl, add the ground meat, egg, minced shallot, half the dill, and nutmeg. Crumble in the bread. Add a couple of healthy pinches of salt and several grinds of freshly cracked pepper, then knead it all together with your hands. Once the meat mixture is well combined, use your hands to roll them into balls approximately half the size of golf balls. You should end up with 24 to 30 meatballs."
- "Put a large non-stick pan on medium heat. Once it&#39;s warmed up, add a tablespoon of butter. When the butter&#39;s completely melted, add the meatballs. You don&#39;t want to crowd the pan, so you&#39;ll have to cook the meatballs in batches. Turn them over frequently so they don&#39;t burn and brown evenly. It&#39;ll take about 15 minutes to cook each batch, depending on the size of your meatballs."
- "Remove the meatballs to a paper-towel lined plate to drain. Skim any meaty chunks from the pan and drain all but a tablespoon of oil. Add the beef stock and bring to a simmer. Make a slurry by mixing the cornstarch with 1/2 cup of water until it&#39;s smooth. Whisk the slurry into the pan. Continue simmering until the sauce thickens to the consistency of gravy."
- "Return the meatballs to the pan and let simmer in the gravy for a few minutes more. Toss in the remaining dill. Serve everything with mashed potatoes and lingonberry jam."

<i>Before you jump to Swedish-y meatballs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. That has fully changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. Accomplish this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. You really need to replace your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. Although costing a little more initially, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Using these longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Along with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently come across members of a family, and often the lights are not turned off until the last person goes to bed. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house also. Do an exercise if you like; check out the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably easy to live green, all things considered. A lot of it is basically making use of common sense.
