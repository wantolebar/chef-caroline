<i>Before you jump to ~Lobster Corn Chowder~ recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently any person who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a spot to start as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. Coupled with different light bulbs, you have to learn to leave the lights off when they are not needed. The kitchen lights especially tend to be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; have a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
