<i>Before you jump to carrot cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

Probably the food isn't quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven uses 75% more energy will motivate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of electricity and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You could well be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not really that hard. It's about being practical, more often than not.
