Let's begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent type, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The family spends major time in the kitchen, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This likewise takes place in the rest of the house, but we are trying to save money in the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off if you don't absolutely need them, and see just how much electricity you can save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is merely using common sense.
