<i>Before you jump to Simple Salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the environment. That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a number of tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your cooking area more green.

Begin with changing the bulbs. Do this for the entire house, not just the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a small amount more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house also. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little elements that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, all things considered. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
