Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

Changing light bulbs is as good a place to begin with as any. This will certainly go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. You really need to replace your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost a little bit more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep a lot of bulbs out of the landfills, which is good. You also have to obtain the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. In the kitchen is where you'll usually find members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. Certainly this also happens in different rooms, not simply the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably easy to live green, of course. A lot of it really is basically utilizing common sense.
