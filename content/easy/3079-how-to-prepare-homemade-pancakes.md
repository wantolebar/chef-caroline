<i>Before you jump to Pancakes! recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good an area to start as any. Do this for the whole house, not merely the kitchen. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which must be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. These bulbs are generally energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is definitely lower, and, while they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than just exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular will often be left on the entire day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This also happens in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are necessary, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that difficult. It's concerning being sensible, usually.
