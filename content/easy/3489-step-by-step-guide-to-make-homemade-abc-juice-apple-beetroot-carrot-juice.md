It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the environment. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having difficulties, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

While it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and maybe this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water or steamed vegetables faster, and use quite a bit less energy, by using countertop appliances. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is particularly economical when it's full before a cycle is started. Conserve even more money by air drying as well as cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

As you can see, there are plenty of little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, of course. A lot of it really is simply utilizing common sense.
