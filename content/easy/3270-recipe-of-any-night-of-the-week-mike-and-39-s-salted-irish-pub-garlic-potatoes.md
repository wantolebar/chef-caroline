recipeinstructions:
- "Using cold water, wash potatoes but do not puncture them whatsoever. Place clean spuds in enough cold water to cover the potatoes by 1&#34;+ of water and add salt. Bring water to a boil with a tight fitting lid and boil spuds for 13 - 15 minutes. Check at 13 minutes.                                                                                         Unlike potatoes that you&#39;d boil for mashed spuds dishes, you&#39;ll notice these spuds are floating. It&#39;s the large amount of salt added causing that reaction. You&#39;ll also notice that your stove top is completely flecked with millions of tiny white dots. It&#39;s the salt as well and cleans up easily."
- "Begin making your butter sauce by adding everything in that specific category and placing on low flame and slowly simmering."
- "Check one potato at 13 minutes for tenderness. You&#39;ll want these as soft and creamy as a baked spud in the center but NOT soggy. Discard that pierced potato, otherwise, it&#39;ll absorb all of the salt in the water and will be inedible."
- "Drain spuds momentarily in sink and allow to quickly dry. Almost instantly their skins will morph into a dried, white, salted coating. Place those hot spuds evenly in serving bowls."
- "Equally pour butter sauce into 4 small Ramekin bowls. Here&#39;s a tip though: A LITTLE BUTTER SAUCE GOES A VERY LONG WAY! So, don&#39;t worry about adding smaller amounts to your Ramekin dishes. :0) Then, lightly drizzle your remaining butter sauce over your plated potatoes. Following that step, garnish your spuds with a light dusting of onion powder, course sea salt, fresh chives, fresh parsley if you have it &amp; grated parmesean cheese. Offer a few toothpicks at serving and always offer an optional side dish of sour cream garnished with chives."
- "Serve with an ice cold Guiness Beer that&#39;s sat properly for at least 2 minutes once poured, before serving it in an ice cold mug as well! This is Irish pub food at its finest and most basic folks! Enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Mike&#39;s Salted Irish Pub Garlic Potatoes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And also Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and also the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. The kitchen area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Changing light bulbs is actually as good a place to begin with as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent type, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost a small amount more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use much less electricity. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it ensures that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will end up at a landfill site. It goes further than simply swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The family spends considerable time in the kitchen, and how often does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. And it's not restricted to the kitchen, it takes place in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be amazed at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. Largely, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
