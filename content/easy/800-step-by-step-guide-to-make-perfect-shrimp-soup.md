<i>Before you jump to Shrimp Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper workout regularly. The worst part is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have enough time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. When our work day is done, most people do not want to go to the gym. We want a yummy, greasy burger, not an equally tasty salad (unless weâ€™re vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Run the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, walk up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. While this will be hard to do if you live on or if your job is on a seriously high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is completely do-able. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an efforts on the stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are all kinds of things that you can do to get healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the solution. You can do tiny things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. Wanting to get in as much physical exercise as possible is another. Don't forget that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You need your body to be powerful too.
