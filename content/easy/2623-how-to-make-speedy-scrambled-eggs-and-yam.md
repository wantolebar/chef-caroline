Remember when the only individuals who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Although it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and maybe this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many individuals incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is started. Conserve even more money by air drying and also cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself gives you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living just isn't that difficult. Mostly, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
