<i>Before you jump to Chickpeas protein salad recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Why don't we begin with something really easy, changing the particular light bulbs. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen. The usual light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which really should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. Although costing a little more originally, these kinds of bulbs last as long as ten of the traditional type as well as using a lot less energy. Making use of these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to get the routine of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a room. The family spends a lot of time in the cooking area, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. This also happens in the rest of the house, but we're trying to save money in the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be surprised at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are many little items that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. It's about being functional, usually.
