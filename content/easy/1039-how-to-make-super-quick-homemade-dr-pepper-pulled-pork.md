<i>Before you jump to DR PEPPER PULLED PORK recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers and hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

A large amount of electricity is definitely consumed by freezers as well as refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by regularly cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Natural living is definitely something we can all do, without difficulty. Mostly, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
