Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Continue reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as economically as they should.
