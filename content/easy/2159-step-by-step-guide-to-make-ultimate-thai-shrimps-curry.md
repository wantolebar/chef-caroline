<i>Before you jump to Thai Shrimps Curry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all know that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle involves. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that getting healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Go up the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work as opposed to using the elevator. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a great way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get extra exercise. 

There are a lot of things that factor into getting healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart about the decisions you make each day is a start. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthy isnâ€™t just about slimming down. You really want your body to be strong too.
