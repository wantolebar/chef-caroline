<i>Before you jump to Pav Bhaji recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and wholesome and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. People crave sweets and salts, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Run the stairs. Instead of choosing the elevator, climb the stairs to your floor. While this will be difficult to do if you live on or if your job is on a super high level floor in a skyscraper, taking the stairs to a home or office on, say, the fifth floor is entirely do-able. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get out of the elevator early and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. So many people pick the elevator over hiking even a single flight of stairs. Even just a individual flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great improvement to your system. 

There are a whole lot of things that contribute to your getting healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. Little things, when done each day, can do a great deal to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being clever when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also important. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. You really want your body to be strong too.
