- "1 tsp rosemary"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "4 cloves garlic sliced"

- "3 Tbsp corn starch"
- "2 Tbsp fresh parsley chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep the ingredients. Combine the water, wine, boullion, Worcestershire, and fish sauce. In a bowl layer the mushrooms, carrots and potatoes. This is so when the vegetables go in, the potatoes will be in the liquid and the mushrooms on top."
- "In the pressure cooker, add 1 Tbsp oil and heat on high. Add the onions and cook until browning, or they release their liquid. (If you&#39;re using a dutch oven, brown the meat first [steps 5-7] in the dutch oven on the stovetop, remove and then follow these directions)."

- "When the paste begins to stick to the bottom, add the liquid."
- "Season the beef chuck with salt."
- "Sear the chuck in a skillet on high heat with a little oil."
- "Degaze the pan with the vermouth and add it to the pressure cooker."
- "Add the chuck to the pressure cooker."
- "Cook on high pressure for 35 min followed by immediate pressure release. If using a dutch oven, cook covered in a 300°F oven for 2-3 hours adding more water as necessary."
- "Add the veggies so the potatoes are on the bottom and mostly submerged, then the carrots, followed by the mushrooms. Cook on high pressure 15 minutes followed by natural pressure relief. If using the dutch oven, cook with the cover ajar 40-50 min more or until the potatoes are tender."
- "Combine the starch with 1/4 cup of water."
- "Remove the pot roast from the pot and set aside."
- "Bring the liquid in the pot to a simmer and add the starch slurry, stirring to thicken."
- "Slice the pot roast, return it to the thickened sauce to reheat."
- "Sprinkle the parsley on and serve in large bowls. I like to add simple steamed green peas as a side."

<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Could save you Money</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers and hippies? Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. These kinds of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you might be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with styles from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The proper temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. Checking that the condenser is definitely clean, which means that the motor needs to work less often, will also save electricity.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is reasonably uncomplicated to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
