<i>Before you jump to Baked Fried Chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all appear to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the industry experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some adjustments. These kinds of adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some approaches to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Perhaps the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, but it will save you money to use it over your oven. Perhaps the realization that an oven makes use of 75% more energy will encourage you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances can boil water or steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly effective when it's full before a cycle is commenced. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are plenty of little elements that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Green living is not that hard. A lot of it really is merely using common sense.
