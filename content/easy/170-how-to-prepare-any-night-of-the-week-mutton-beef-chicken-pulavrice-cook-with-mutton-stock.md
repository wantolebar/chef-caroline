It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These kinds of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Continue reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. The correct temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving energy and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and also 0F. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
