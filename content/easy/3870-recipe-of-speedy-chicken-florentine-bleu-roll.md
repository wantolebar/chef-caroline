- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tsp pepper"

recipeinstructions:
- "Slice mushrooms and fry in butter at medium high heat until browned slightly. Try not to stir often so they brown faster and not just turn watery. Set aside on plate when done."
- "Fry bacon until crispy. Remove from pan and chop into peices. Remove all but 2 tbs of the bacon grease. This is needed for next step."
- "Add the onion to the frying pan with the remaining bacon grease left in the pan. Saute onions over medium heat until tender."
- "Add the mushrooms, bacon peices, and fresh spinach to the onions and continue to cook until the spinach is wilted. Remove from heat and set aside."
- "Pound the chicken breasts flat with the smooth side if meat mallet. Lay out plastic wrap on counter and lay flattened breast on wrap so it forms a rectangular shape with the breasts edges overlapping so it looks like picture below. Season with the salt and pepper."
- "Layer the chicken with the ham then the swiss cheese on the chicken."
- "Spread the mixture from the frying pan thinly over the swiss cheese."
- "Roll the chicken up jelly roll style. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours."
- "Set up a dredging station with flour, then eggs, and thirdly the bread crumbs. I used cookie sheets. Then using wooden skewers, insert several where the overlap is so the chicken doesn&#39;t separate while cooking."
- "Bake on a wire rack at 375° until internal temperature reaches 165°. Cooking time is approximately 70 to 80 minutes."
- "Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the paste cooks and bubbles a bit, but don&#39;t let it brown — about 2 minutes. Add the milk and dijon mustard, continuing to stir as the sauce thickens. Bring it to a boil. Add salt and pepper to taste, lower the heat, and cook, stirring for 2 to 3 minutes more. Add cheddar cheese and stir until cheese is melted. Remove from the heat."

<i>Before you jump to Chicken Florentine/Bleu Roll recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already realize that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. The unfortunate thing is that, at the end of the day, we don't always have the time or energy required for a healthy lifestyle. At the conclusion of the day, the majority of us want to go home, not to the gym. A juicy, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a crunchy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be pleased to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. With practice you can get all of the nutritional requirements and the physical exercise that you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Take the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, utilizing the stairs is a excellent way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can choose to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Most people will choose to be lazy and take an elevator instead of choosing exercise on the stairs. That one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are a good deal of things that factor into getting healthy. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Being intelligent when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. Getting as much exercise as you possibly can is another factor. Don't ignore that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
