<i>Before you jump to Mackerel Thai Red Curry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. These types of modifications need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some methods to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

A lot of electrical power is actually wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old versions that are more than ten years old. Maintaining the temperature of the fridge at 37F, along with 0F for the freezer, will certainly save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. You can certainly minimize how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. Largely, all it will take is a bit of common sense.
