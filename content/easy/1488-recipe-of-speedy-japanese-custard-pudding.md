- "120 g Granulated sugar"
- "2 tbsp Water"
- "100 mL Boiling water"
- " Egg Mixture"
- "8 eggs"
- "130 g Sugar"
- "960 mL Milk"
- "1 tsp Vanilla extract paste or oil"
- " Tools"
- " Pot"
- "2 trays one small enough to fit in the other"
- " Ladle"
- " Whisk"
- " Something to mix with wooden spoons silicone spatula etc"
- " Sifter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 300°F"
- "Let’s make the caramel. In a pot that will be big enough to hold all of the milk, add the sugar and on medium heat. When the pot heats up a little, pour in your tiny bit of water. It should sizzle a little bit and bubble. The water will get soaked up by the sugar. Don’t touch, don’t mix."
- "Let the pot sit on medium heat without mixing it. You can move it around by moving the pot but try not to stir. If there are any large sugar clumps, you can push that in, but don’t stir. Wait until it becomes a little brown. Prepare the boiling water."
- "When the whole thing becomes a dark brown, turn off the heat, and quickly pour in the hot water. It will sizzle and smoke and splash a little bit so put a lid on the pot. When the splashing and sizzling has gone down, take the lid off. Check the consistency of the caramel. If it is still a bit fluid, keep resting it. Onces it thicken, the caramel is done. You want it to be a bit burnt to get that bitter-sweet flavour."
- "Once the caramel thickens, pour it into a smaller tray. It will be really thick and paste like, but spread it out as much as you can before it hardens. It’s okay if it’s not completely spread, it will spread in the oven."
- "Now we’ll make the egg mixture for the pudding. Take the pot you used for the caramel and put it back on the stovetop. With all the caramel remnants still on it, pour in the milk and sugar. Stir on medium to low heat, gradually dissolving the caramel and sugar into the milk."
- "While the milk is heating up, crack 8 whole eggs in a bowl and whisk."
- "When the milk comes to a simmer, take it off the heat and pour it little by little into the eggs, all the while mixing it together. Mix in vanilla."
- "Make sure the small tray with the caramel sits in the larger tray. Pour boiling water in the larger tray, to create a bath for the smaller tray. Fill large tray up halfway at least. In the small tray, pour the mix mixture through a sifter to get rid of any unmixed eggs, any unwanted remnants."
- "Place in the oven for 45 minutes. When finished, take it out and let it cool."
- "Once cooled, wrap with plastic wrap and place the the refrigerator for a couple hours or overnight. After chilled, use an offset spatula or a knife and run it along the edge of the pudding, releasing it off the sides. Then, place a sheet tray or a serving tray on top and flip to remove the pudding. Cut into pieces and enjoy!"

<i>Before you jump to Japanese Custard Pudding recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Can save you Cash</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared burden we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start taking place, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Keep reading for some approaches to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is as good a spot to start as any. This will go further than the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you must use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost a little bit more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. Along with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. The kitchen lights in particular are often left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. This likewise occurs in the rest of the house, but we are trying to save money in the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the quantity of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

The kitchen on its own offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. It's related to being practical, most of the time.

##### Steps to make Japanese Custard Pudding:

1. Preheat the oven to 300°F
1. Let’s make the caramel. In a pot that will be big enough to hold all of the milk, add the sugar and on medium heat. When the pot heats up a little, pour in your tiny bit of water. It should sizzle a little bit and bubble. The water will get soaked up by the sugar. Don’t touch, don’t mix.
1. Let the pot sit on medium heat without mixing it. You can move it around by moving the pot but try not to stir. If there are any large sugar clumps, you can push that in, but don’t stir. Wait until it becomes a little brown. Prepare the boiling water.
1. When the whole thing becomes a dark brown, turn off the heat, and quickly pour in the hot water. It will sizzle and smoke and splash a little bit so put a lid on the pot. When the splashing and sizzling has gone down, take the lid off. Check the consistency of the caramel. If it is still a bit fluid, keep resting it. Onces it thicken, the caramel is done. You want it to be a bit burnt to get that bitter-sweet flavour.
1. Once the caramel thickens, pour it into a smaller tray. It will be really thick and paste like, but spread it out as much as you can before it hardens. It’s okay if it’s not completely spread, it will spread in the oven.
1. Now we’ll make the egg mixture for the pudding. Take the pot you used for the caramel and put it back on the stovetop. With all the caramel remnants still on it, pour in the milk and sugar. Stir on medium to low heat, gradually dissolving the caramel and sugar into the milk.
1. While the milk is heating up, crack 8 whole eggs in a bowl and whisk.
1. When the milk comes to a simmer, take it off the heat and pour it little by little into the eggs, all the while mixing it together. Mix in vanilla.
1. Make sure the small tray with the caramel sits in the larger tray. Pour boiling water in the larger tray, to create a bath for the smaller tray. Fill large tray up halfway at least. In the small tray, pour the mix mixture through a sifter to get rid of any unmixed eggs, any unwanted remnants.
1. Place in the oven for 45 minutes. When finished, take it out and let it cool.
1. Once cooled, wrap with plastic wrap and place the the refrigerator for a couple hours or overnight. After chilled, use an offset spatula or a knife and run it along the edge of the pudding, releasing it off the sides. Then, place a sheet tray or a serving tray on top and flip to remove the pudding. Cut into pieces and enjoy!
