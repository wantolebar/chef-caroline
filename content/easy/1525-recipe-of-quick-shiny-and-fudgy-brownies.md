<i>Before you jump to Shiny and Fudgy Brownies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Spending less Within the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the ecosystem. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This needs to happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Although it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave instead of in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. You get the maximum energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes using heat, use the cool dry or air dry functions to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is definitely something we can all perform, without difficulty. Largely, all it takes is a little common sense.
