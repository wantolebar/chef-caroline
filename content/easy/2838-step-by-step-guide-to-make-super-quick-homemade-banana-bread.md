<i>Before you jump to Banana bread recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only individuals who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These adjustments need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going much more green.

Start out with changing the light bulbs. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to merely the kitchen. The normal light bulbs are the incandescent style, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more at first, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Using these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Coupled with different light bulbs, you need to learn to leave the lights off whenever they are not needed. In the kitchen is where you'll frequently come across members of a family, and often the lights may not be turned off until the last person goes to bed. This likewise happens in the rest of the house, but we have been trying to save money in the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that difficult. A lot of it is merely utilizing common sense.
