<i>Before you jump to Chicken Parmigiana recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green Plus Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the ecosystem were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet and the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active participation. This must happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

A lot of electrical power is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. If you happen to be in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with types from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less energy. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F as well as 0F. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, of course. Mostly, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
