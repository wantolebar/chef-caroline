<i>Before you jump to Cream of chicken soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen area Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going a lot more green.

Refrigerators and freezers use a lot of electricity, particularly if they are not working as economically as they should. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones which might be more than ten years old. Always keeping the temperature of the fridge at 37F, in conjunction with 0F for the freezer, will probably save on electricity, while keeping food at the correct temperature. Checking that the condenser is actually clean, which means that the motor needs to operate less regularly, will also save electricity.

The kitchen alone gives you many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Efficient living is actually something we can all do, without difficulty. A lot of it really is simply making use of common sense.
