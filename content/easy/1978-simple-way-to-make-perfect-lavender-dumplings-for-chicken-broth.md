<i>Before you jump to Lavender Dumplings - For Chicken Broth recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Lowering costs Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any individual who indicated concern about the degradation of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. This should happen soon and living in approaches more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, primarily by making your kitchen area more green.

A large amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. If you're in the market for a new one, the good news is that compared with models from 10 or more years ago, they use about 60% less electricity. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can certainly cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is not really that tough. Mostly, all it will take is a little common sense.
