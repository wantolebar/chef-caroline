<i>Before you jump to Fudge Brownies &amp; White Chocolate Mint Whipped Cream recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Techniques To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. Each and every family should start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. The kitchen area is a good place to begin saving energy by going more green.

Maybe the food is not quite as good when cooked in the microwave, however it will save you money to use it over your oven. Possibly the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a great deal of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned way, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is specifically economical when it's full before a cycle is started. By cool drying or air drying the dishes as opposed to heat drying them, you can raise the amount of money you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. Eco-friendly living is not really that tough. It's related to being functional, usually.
