recipeinstructions:

Add the rest of the spices and pan roast for a further 3 - 5 minutes until the spices start to brown, toast and become aromatic. Keep moving the pan to prevent the spices from burning. Remove from the heat and let the spices cool. Once the spices cool down - use a spice grinder (or a mortar and pestle) to grind the spice mix into a powder in batches and mix well. Store"
- "Heat the oil in a large heavy-based saucepan, add the onions, curry leaves, chillies and cook for a few minutes or until the onions are golden"
- "Add the coconut paste.. saute&#39; Add the curry powder, chilli powder and turmeric mix in and add the crab and cook for another 3 minutes, at this stage you need to stir it a lot so the spices don’t burn."
- "Then add the coconut milk, the tamarind paste, stir and add the water."
- "Cover and simmer for 12 minutes or until crab is just cooked through and sauce has thickened. Stir in the drumstick leaves, lime juice and season to taste with salt. Enjoy with hit steamed rice.."

<i>Before you jump to Srilankan crab curry # surf recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all realize that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced meal plans are important as are good amounts of exercise. Unfortunately, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is finished, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making wise decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you keep going with it, you'll get all of the required exercise and healthy food. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy.

Make smart decisions when shopping for groceries. When you make informed and wise purchases at the grocery store, your meals will get much healthier immediately. Think for a second: you don't want to go to a busy grocery store or sit in a lengthy line at the drive thru at the end of your day. You want to go to your house and make something from your kitchen. Make sure that what you have at home is healthy. By doing this, even when you decide that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are a good deal of things that contribute to your getting healthy. An costly gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Make smart choices every day is a great start. Getting as much physical exercise as possible is another factor. Don't overlook that health isn't only about how much you weigh. You really want your body to be strong too.
