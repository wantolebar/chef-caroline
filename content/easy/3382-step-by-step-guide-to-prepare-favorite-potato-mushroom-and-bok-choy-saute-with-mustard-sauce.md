<i>Before you jump to Potato, mushroom and bok-choy sauté with mustard sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it appears we all realize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. These types of changes need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Read on for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is definitely as good a place get started on as any. Obviously you shouldn't confine this to only the kitchen area. You should upgrade your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. These bulbs are usually energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is lower, and, even though they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. One of the advantages is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. You also have to obtain the habit of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a place. The family spends major time in the kitchen, and how frequently does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Of course this also happens in some other rooms, not merely the kitchen. Do an exercise if you like; take a look at the amount of electricity you can save by turning the lights off when you don't need them.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is reasonably straightforward to live green, after all. Mostly, all it requires is a bit of common sense.
