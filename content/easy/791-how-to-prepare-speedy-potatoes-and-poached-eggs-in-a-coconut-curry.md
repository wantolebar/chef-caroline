recipeinstructions:
- "Before we begin, make sure you use a WIDE and deep sauce pot. This gives the eggs room to poach well and the eggs won&#39;t disintegrate with the curry!"
- "Heat some oil and add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds. When they start spluttering all over the place, add the minced ginger and garlic, green chillies and onions and saute. Once the onions are soft, add the potatoes and squash and the curry powders. Add a little water and allow it cook for a few minutes"
- "A few minutes later add the tomatoes, and a few cups of water and the cup of coconut milk. Add the required amount of salt and some curry powder if needed. Stir well and allow it to cook. When the potatoes and squash are cooked through, it will be time for the eggs to go in. Simmer on medium-low heat for 10-15mins and allow the potatoes and squash to cook through"
- "Test a potato in the pot and if it feels cooked (soft and mushy), if it is, break the eggs one by one into the pot. Do it slow and make sure the eggs don&#39;t break. It might sound tricky but it was not that difficult!"
- "Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with a lid. Cook for 5mins until the yolk is cooked. I cooked till I got a firm yolk, if you want a runny yolk it should take less than 5mins. Once done, allow the curry to rest for a few minutes before serving"
- "Serve warm with some rice, roti or bread"
