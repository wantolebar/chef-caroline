<i>Before you jump to Grilled corn on the cob recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That has totally changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. Unless everyone begins to start living more eco-friendly we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they must do this soon. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going a lot more green.

A massive amount of electricity is consumed by freezers and refrigerators, and it's even worse if they are working inefficiently. You can save up to 60% on energy when you get a new one, when compared with those from longer than ten years ago. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use much less electricity. You can certainly reduce how often the motor has to run by frequently cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

From the above it really should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it truly is simply using common sense.
