Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers along with hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everyone being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared obligation we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more eco-friendly we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Read on for some methods to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Even though it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Compared with your stove, you can make boiled water as well as steamed vegetables faster, and use considerably less energy, by using countertop appliances. Many men and women incorrectly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a lesser amount of energy than a dishwasher. Especially if you make sure the dishwasher is full previous to starting a cycle. By cool drying or air drying the dishes instead of heat drying them, you can increase the amount of money you save.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it is merely using common sense.
