If you do work on a extremely high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the additional boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get wholesome. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or restricted diets. Little things, when done every single day, can do a lot to help you get healthy and lose pounds. Being intelligent when you choose your food and actions is where it begins.
