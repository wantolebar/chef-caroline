<i>Before you jump to Cookie Biscotti Sticks recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Can save you Money</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active participation. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, mainly by making your kitchen more green.

Start with exchanging the lights. This will go beyond the kitchen, but that is okay. The typical light bulbs are the incandescent variety, which should be replaced with compact fluorescent lightbulbs, which save energy. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Using these types of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. You also have to acquire the practice of turning off the lights when there is nobody in a area. The kitchen lights specifically are often left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Make a habit of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

From the above it really should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, after all. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
