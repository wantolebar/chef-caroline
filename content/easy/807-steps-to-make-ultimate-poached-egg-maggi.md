Until fairly recently any person who expressed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows.

Unless everyone begins to start living much more environmentally friendly we won't be able to fix the problems of the environment. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, largely in the kitchen.

Although it may not taste as good, preparing food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is greater by 75%, and perhaps this little bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. Countertop appliances can boil water or even steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You will be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it ought to be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is quite straightforward to live green, all things considered. Typically, all it will take is a little bit of common sense.
