recipeingredient:
- "1 lb ground chicken"
- "2 C Bibligo Korean BBQ"
- "1/2 C Raw Honey"
- "1/3 tsp ginger"
- "1/3 tsp cayenne pepper"
- "1 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 tsp black pepper"
- "1 package mini slider buns"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your skillet on medium with Olive Oil."
- "Form the ground chicken into small patties, about half the size of your palm. (Since Chicken doesn’t have anywhere close to the fat content that beef has, the patties won’t shrink down when cooking.)"
- "In a medium mixing bowl or freezer bag, add 1C of bibligo korean bbq sauce, half of the honey, and the dry seasonings. Mix the marinade well and set aside."
- "Coat the patties VERY GENTLY in the marinade, ground chicken tends to get mushy pretty easily when it gets wet so you have to be very careful!"
- "Cook the patties at medium heat until they are cooked through and have a nice caramelized color."
- "Add 1C of bibligo Korean bbq sauce and the honey to the pan. Lower the heat and coat the burgers in the sauce as the sauce thickens. Should only take about 3-5 minutes to thicken up. The sauce will stick to the burgers like syrup, once that happens they are all done!"
- "Toast the slider buns, if desired. I like to add honey to one side of the bun, along with the extra sauce from the pan. Serve these with a side of Rice or Pasta."

<i>Before you jump to Korean BBQ Chicken Burger Sliders recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a naturally healthy and balanced diet and get a proper amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Working out at the gym isn't something people want to do when they get off from work. We want a delicious, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy decisions doesn’t have to be a chore. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthful.

Run the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work as an alternative to using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as plausible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. Even if your office or home is on one of the highest floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Lots of people choose the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a handful of times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are lots of things you can pursue to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent when you choose your food and routines is where it begins. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also important. Don't overlook that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You want your body to be strong too.
