<i>Before you jump to Italian style meatloaf
 no catchup needed !!! recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Spend less Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was certainly not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the environment. Those days are over, and it appears we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we cannot transform things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

A lot of electricity is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not working efficiently. When you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old models that happen to be more than ten years old. The appropriate temperature for food is 37F in the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, because the motor won't have to run as often.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living is not really that difficult. It's about being sensible, usually.
