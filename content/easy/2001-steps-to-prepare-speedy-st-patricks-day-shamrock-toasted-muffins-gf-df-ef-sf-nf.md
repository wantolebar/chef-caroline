<i>Before you jump to St Patricks Day Shamrock Toasted Muffins, GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Spending less Inside the Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who expressed concern about the wreckage of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has fully changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. According to the experts, to clean up the natural environment we are all going to have to make some improvements. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

While it may not taste as good, baking food in the microwave rather than in the oven will save you a packet of money. Maybe the realization that an oven utilizes 75% more energy will stimulate you to use the microwave more. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water as well as steam vegetables faster than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is certainly not true. A dishwasher is particularly efficient when it's full before a cycle is going. By cool drying or perhaps air drying the dishes besides heat drying them, you can add to the amount of money you save.

The kitchen on its own provides you with many small ways by which energy and money can be saved. Green living is not that difficult. Largely, all it takes is a little bit of common sense.
