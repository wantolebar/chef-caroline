recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 375f/190c. Grease and flour a 9&#34; cake tin (tap out any excess flour), and set aside."
- "In a large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients."
- "In a separate bowl, beat together wet ingredients."
- "Add wet ingredients to the dry and whisk until smooth. Note: you can add the chocolate chips at this point and mix them in, though I prefer to top the batter with them after I pour it into the cake tin."
- "For the cinnamon topping, simply combine all the ingredients."
- "Pour cake batter into the pan. Then, if you haven&#39;t added them yet, top with chocolate chips (coating the chips in flour suspends them in the batter and keeps them from all sinking to the bottom), followed by the cinnamon mix. DO NOT top with the pecans yet because they will burn in the cooking (I speak from experience)."
- "Bake for 20-25 minutes. When fully cooked (I do the clean toothpick test), remove from the oven and place on a wire rack. Top it with pecans while still hot. Let the cake cool fully before serving."

<strong>Methods To Live Green Plus Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

It was not really that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern about the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it appears we all comprehend our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. Each and every family must start generating changes that are environmentally friendly and they should do this soon. The cooking area is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

Let us begin with something really easy, changing the light bulbs. This will certainly go outside of the kitchen, but that is okay. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them instead of incandescent lights. They cost somewhat more initially, but they last ten times longer, and use less electricity. Utilizing these kinds of longer-lasting lightbulbs has the particular benefit that many fewer lightbulbs make it into landfills. Together with different light bulbs, you should learn to leave the lights off if they are not needed. The family spends a lot of time in the kitchen area, and how typically does the kitchen light go on in the morning and is left on all day long. Of course this also happens in other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and discover how much electricity you can save.

The kitchen on its own gives you many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, after all. Largely, all it will take is a little common sense.
