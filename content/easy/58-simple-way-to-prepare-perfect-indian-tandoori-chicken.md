<i>Before you jump to indian tandoori chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Spending less In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only men and women who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and conceivably reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the industry experts, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some adjustments. This needs to happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become an objective for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, mainly in the kitchen.

You may possibly prefer cooking food with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you way less money. As soon as you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will certainly boil water or steam vegetables more rapidly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. Many people mistakenly believe that doing the dishes by hand uses a reduced amount of energy than a dishwasher. Mainly if you make sure the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes by using heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry options to increase the money you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Eco-friendly living is not really that difficult. It's related to being practical, usually.
