<i>Before you jump to Porkchop Kare Kare recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Methods To Live Green And Conserve Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern concerning the well-being of the surroundings. Those days are over, and it seems we all recognize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. Unless everyone begins to start living a lot more green we won't be able to resolve the problems of the environment. These types of modifications need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The cooking area is a good starting point saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of energy is definitely wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. The proper temperature for food is 37F within the fridge and 0F in the freezer, and sticking to these will use a lesser amount of electricity. You can easily cut down how often the motor has to run by routinely cleaning the condenser, which will save on electricity.

As you can see, there are lots of little items that you can do to save energy, and save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty easy to live green, all things considered. It's concerning being functional, more often than not.
