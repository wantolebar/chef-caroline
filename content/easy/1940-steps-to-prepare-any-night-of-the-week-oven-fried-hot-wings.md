<i>Before you jump to Oven fried hot wings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be well balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. Going to the gym isn't something people make time for when they get off from work. People crave junk food, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some basic ways to get healthy.

Run the stairs. Stroll up the stairs to where you live or work instead of using the elevator. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Lots of people opt for the easy elevator ride instead of making an effort on the stairs. Even if you only have just one flight to climb, climbing along it during the day is a great way to get additional exercise. 

There are all sorts of activities that you can do to get healthy and balanced. Not all of them demand fancy gym memberships or limited diets. You can do tiny things each day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being clever when you choose your food and activities is where it begins. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also necessary. Remember: being healthful isn’t just about reducing your weight. It is more about making your body as strong as it can be.
