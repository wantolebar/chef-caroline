The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this small bit of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently.

You might think that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, nonetheless that is definitely not true. You get the highest energy savings by completely loading the dishwasher just before commencing a wash cycle.
