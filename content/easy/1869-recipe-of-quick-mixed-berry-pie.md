- " Pie Crusts"
- " Mixed Berries Roughly"
- " water"
- " Sugar"
- " Lemon Soda"
- " Orange Extract"
- " Egg"
- " Corn Starch"
- " Sugar for topping"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pour berries into a large pot. Pour in water and sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat. Let simmer about 20 minutes. Mash berries with potato masher. Simmer a bit longer and repeat. I wanted some texture, but you can mash until your hearts content."
- "When berries have reached your desired consistency, add in lemon soda. (You can substitute with another citrus soda containing real juice)."
- "Reduce by about half. Mix corn starch with a little bit of water to make a thickening agent. Add to berries."
- "After berry mix has thickened, take off heat until cooled to room temperature. Take your pie crusts and let them sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Unroll one on your pie pan. Add berries in."
- "Now... you could just plop the top on, make an x in the middle and call it a day... but I opted to try to make it pretty. Using a pizza cutter, I sliced the dough and arranged it as so. Brush on egg, sprinkle top with sugar, trim excess dough and cover sides with foil to prevent burning."
- "Preheat oven to 375 F. Place pie on cookie sheet, bake for 40 minutes. Remove foil. Back an additional 15-20 minutes. If your pie is beginning to bubble and brown nicely before then, remove foil at that time and bake a bit more. Once pie is bubbling and browned, it’s done. Allow to cool completely so the pie can set up. Slice and serve."

<i>Before you jump to Mixed Berry Pie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already know that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. However, we do not always have the time or the power that this type of lifestyle demands. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. A delicious, grease laden burger is usually our food of choice and not a leafy green salad (unless we are vegetarians). You will be delighted to discover that achieving good health doesn't have to be hard. If you are persistent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food you need. Here are some of the best ways to be healthy and balanced.

Take the stairs. Instead of picking the elevator, ascend the stairs to your floor. Obviously this isn’t as possible if you work on the 25th floor of a high rise, but if you work on the fourth, climbing the stairs is a excellent way to get some exercise in. If you do work on a super high floor, why not get off the elevator a couple of floors early and walk the rest of the way? So many people pick the elevator over climbing even a single flight of stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a few times a day—can be just the added boost that your system needs. 

There are many things you can pursue to become healthy. Intensive gym visits and directly defined diets are not always the solution. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and getting healthy. Being intelligent about the choices you make each day is a start. A suitable amount of physical activity each day is also important. Don't forget that health isn't only about simply how much you weigh. You need your body to be powerful too.
