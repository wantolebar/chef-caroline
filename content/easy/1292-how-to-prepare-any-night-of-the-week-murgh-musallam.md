<i>Before you jump to Murgh musallam recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Tips For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it seems we all realize our role in stopping and perhaps reversing the damage being done to our planet. According to the specialists, to clean up the surroundings we are all going to have to make some changes. This must happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a goal for every individual family. The cooking area is a good place to start saving energy by going a lot more green.

Let us begin with something not that hard, changing the light bulbs. Of course you shouldn't confine this to just the kitchen. You need to change your incandescent lights with energy-saver, compact fluorescent light bulbs. They cost somewhat more in the beginning, but they last ten times longer, and use a lesser amount of electricity. Changing the light bulbs would keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that's good. It goes further than just swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is actually another good thing to do. The kitchen lights especially are often left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not simply the kitchen. Try keeping the lights off until you absolutely need them, and notice how much electricity you can save.

From the above it really should be clear that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are many little opportunities for saving energy and money. Eco-friendly living is not that hard. It's related to being functional, most of the time.
