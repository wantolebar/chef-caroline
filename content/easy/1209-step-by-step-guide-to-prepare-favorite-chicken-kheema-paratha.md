<i>Before you jump to Chicken Kheema Paratha recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Cooking area Could save you Cash</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with all people being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared burden we have for turning things around. According to the experts, to clean up the environment we are all going to have to make some changes. This needs to happen soon and living in ways more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

You may prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. The energy used by cooking in an oven is definitely greater by 75%, and possibly this small amount of knowledge will spur you on to use the microwave more frequently. When it pertains to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save plenty of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might reckon that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, however that is definitely not true. Especially if you make certain the dishwasher is full before starting a cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, utilize the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

From the above it should be obvious that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are lots of little opportunities for saving energy and money. Green living is actually something we can all accomplish, without difficulty. A lot of it truly is simply using common sense.
