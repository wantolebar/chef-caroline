<i>Before you jump to Bacon Wrapped Shrimp Stuffed Jalapenos recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Green Living In The Kitchen Will Save You Dollars</strong>.</i>

It was not that long ago that hippies and tree huggers were the only ones to show concern regarding the well-being of the surroundings. That's a thing of the past now, with everybody being aware of the problems besetting the planet as well as the shared responsibility we have for turning things around. Unless everyone begins to start living much more green we won't be able to correct the problems of the environment. Each and every family must start making changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your cooking area more green.

You may prefer cooking with your oven, but using a microwave instead will cost you much less money. When you find out it will require 75% more energy to cook in the oven, chances are you'll look for more ways to use the microwave. When it comes to boiling water and steaming vegetables, you can save a lot of energy and do the job faster with countertop appliances rather than a stove. You might believe that you save energy by washing your dishes by hand, but that is not true. You get the maximum energy savings by totally loading the dishwasher ahead of commencing a wash cycle. Preserve even more money by air drying or cool drying your dishes instead of heat drying them.

The kitchen by itself offers you many small means by which energy and money can be saved. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that hard. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
