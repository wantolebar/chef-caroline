Until fairly recently anyone who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are not able to transform things for the better without everyone's active contribution. Each and every family should start creating changes that are environmentally friendly and they have to do this soon. Here are some tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Although it may not taste as good, cooking food in the microwave as an alternative to in the oven will save you a packet of money. When you find out it will take 75% more energy to cook in the oven, you could possibly look for more ways to use the microwave. Countertop appliances will boil water as well as steam vegetables more quickly than your stove, and use a lot less electricity. You would be forgiven for thinking that an automatic dishwasher uses a lot more energy than washing dishes the old-fashioned method, but you would be wrong. You get the highest energy savings by fully loading the dishwasher before commencing a wash cycle. Don't dry the dishes with heat, make use of the cool dry or air dry features to increase the money you save.

As you can see, there are many little things that you can do to save energy, and also save money, in the kitchen alone. Environmentally friendly living just isn't that difficult. A lot of it truly is basically making use of common sense.
