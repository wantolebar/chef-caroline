<i>Before you jump to &#34;Slap Ya Mama&#34; Potato Soup recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Suggestions For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>

Until fairly recently any person who indicated concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has completely changed now, since we all seem to have an awareness that the planet is having problems, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to change things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These kinds of adjustments need to start occurring, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. The kitchen is a good place to begin saving energy by going much more green.

A lot of energy is wasted when fridges and freezers, both heavy users of electricity anyway, are not operating efficiently. If you can get a new one, they use about 60% less than the old ones that happen to be more than ten years old. The right temperature settings for your fridge and freezer, whereby you'll be saving electrical power and optimising the preservation of food, is 37F and 0F. An additional way to save electricity is to keep the condenser clean, for the reason that the motor won't have to run as often.

From the above it should be apparent that just in the kitchen, by itself, there are numerous little opportunities for saving energy and money. It is pretty easy to live green, after all. Typically, all it requires is a little bit of common sense.
