<i>Before you jump to Coconut Cookies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Ways To Live Green And Save Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Until fairly recently anyone who portrayed concern about the destruction of the environment raised skeptical eyebrows. That has totally changed now, since we all apparently have an awareness that the planet is having troubles, and we all have a part to play in fixing it. The experts are agreed that we are unable to adjust things for the better without everyone's active contribution. These types of changes need to start happening, and each individual family needs to become more environmentally friendly. Here are a few tips that can help you save energy, for the most part by making your kitchen area more green.

Start out with replacing the lights. Naturally you shouldn't confine this to just the cooking area. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are generally energy-savers, and you should use them rather than incandescent lights. These bulbs are energy-efficient which means electricity consumption is actually lower, and, although they cost a bit more to buy, will outlast an incandescent light ten times over. Changing the light bulbs would likely keep plenty of bulbs out of the landfills, and that is good. It goes further than simply exchanging the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular tend to be left on all day long, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. Obviously this also happens in other rooms, not just the kitchen. Make a practice of having the lights on only when they are required, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

As you can see, there are lots of little things that you can do to save energy, as well as save money, in the kitchen alone. It is pretty uncomplicated to live green, of course. It's about being practical, usually.
