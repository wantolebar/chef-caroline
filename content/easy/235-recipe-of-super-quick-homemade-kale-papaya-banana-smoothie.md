<i>Before you jump to Kale-Papaya-Banana Smoothie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>

Everybody knows that in order to truly be healthy you need to eat a nutritious and balanced diet and get a proper level of exercise. Sadly, we do not always have the time or the energy that this type of lifestyle requires. When our work day is finished, most people do not prefer to go to the gym. We want a tasty, greasy burger, not an equally delightful salad (unless we’re vegetarians). The good news is that making healthy choices doesn’t have to be irritating. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and healthy food choices you need. Here are some of the best methods to be healthy and balanced.

Consider the stairs. Rather than riding an elevator, take the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, making use of the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if your office or home is on one of the top floors, you can decide to get off of the elevator early and take the stairs the remainder of the way. Most people will choose to be sluggish and take an elevator instead of getting exercise on the stairs. Even just a single flight of stairs, when travelled up or down a few times a day--can be a great boost to your system. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy. Extensive gym visits and narrowly defined diets are not always the answer. It is the little things you choose each day that really help you with weight loss and becoming healthy. Make shrewd choices every day is a great start. A good amount of physical activity each day is also important. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about slimming down. You need to help to make your body as strong it can be.
