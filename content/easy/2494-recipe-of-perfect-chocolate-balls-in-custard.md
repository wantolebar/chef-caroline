<i>Before you jump to Chocolate balls in custard recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about 
<strong>Guidelines For Living Green And Saving Money In The Kitchen</strong>.</i>
</br>

Remember when the only people who cared about the natural environment were tree huggers as well as hippies? Those days are over, and it looks like we all recognize our role in stopping and possibly reversing the damage being done to our planet. The experts are agreed that we are not able to change things for the better without everyone's active involvement. This must happen soon and living in methods more friendly to the environment should become a mission for every individual family. Keep reading for some ways to go green and save energy, generally in the kitchen.

Changing light bulbs is as good a spot to start as any. Complete this for the entire house, not only the kitchen. Compact fluorescent lightbulbs are usually energy-savers, and you should use them in place of incandescent lights. Although costing a little more initially, these types of bulbs last as long as ten of the standard type as well as using a lot less energy. One of the pluses is that for every one of these lightbulbs used, it means that approximately ten normal lightbulbs less will certainly end up at a landfill site. It goes further than just swapping the lights, though; turning off lights that aren't needed is definitely another good thing to do. The kitchen lights in particular will often be left on the whole day, just because the family tends to spend a lot of time there. And it's not confined to the kitchen, it goes on in other parts of the house at the same time. Make a routine of having the lights on only when they are needed, and you'll be astonished at the amount of electricity you save.

The kitchen alone provides you with many small methods by which energy and money can be saved. It is quite uncomplicated to live green, after all. Largely, all it takes is a bit of common sense.
