- " For the Dumplings"
- "2 Cups Baking Mix Bisquick"
- "1 Teaspoon Seasoning Salt"
- "1 Tablespoons Chopped Celery Leaves"
- "2/3 Cup Whole Milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large Stock pot combine the first nine ingredients. Bring up just to a slow simmer, cover and let cook for 1 to 1.5 hours. Stir around every once in a while. Stock will be done when chicken is tender. When cool enough to handle, remove the chicken and hand shred all the meat from the bones. Strain stock through a seive, discarding vegetable pieces and any other unwanted pieces. Set aside until ready for use."
- "To make the soup combine the chicken stock, celery, and carrots. Bring to a low boil and let cook until vegetables are tender. Around 30 minutes. Next add the celery soup and leaves, shredded chicken meat, salt and ground pepper. Bring back to a simmer. Now is the time to adjust the salt!"
- "Mix together the baking mix, seasoned salt, and chopped celery leaves. Add the milk into the dry ingredients, and stir together until a dough forms. Dough will be sticky. It helps to put the dough in the refrigerator for a short while and let chill somewhat. Makes it easier to handle."
- "Spoon drop dumpling mixture into the simmering soup. Keep in mind that the dumplings will swell about twice their size as they cook. Let cook covered for 20-30 minutes until dumplings are set and fully cooked. Gently flip over halfway during the cooking time. Add additional stock if needed as the dumplings absorb some of the stock. I hope you and your family enjoy."

<i>Before you jump to Lee&#39;s Homemade Chicken and Dumplings recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>

We all understand that, in order to really be healthy and balanced, nutritious and balanced diets are important as are good amounts of exercise. Sadly, there isn't often enough time or energy for us to really do the things we need to do. Going to the gym isn't something people decide to do when they get off from work. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You should be pleased to learn that getting healthy doesn't always have to be super hard work. With practice you can get all of the nutrients and the exercise that you need. Here are some tips to be as healthy as possible.

When you go to the grocery store, be sensible about it. If you make smart choices when you are purchasing your groceries, you will be eating better meals by default. Think about it: you aren’t going to want to cope with a busy store or a long drive through line at the end of the day. You’re going to go home and cook what you have on hand. Your house should be filled with healthy foods and ingredients. By doing this, even when you determine that you want something greasy or not super nutritous, you will still be choosing items that are healthier for you than you would probably choose while running into a store or fast food restaurant.

There are plenty of things you can do to become healthy. An expensive gym membership and very hard to stick to diets are not the only way to do it. You can do little things every day to improve upon your health and lose weight. Being intelligent about the selections you make each day is a start. Trying to get in as much exercise as possible is another. The numbers on the scale aren't the only indicator of your healthfulness. You want your body to be strong too.
