<i>Before you jump to Tastiest beef and vegetable stir fry recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about <strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>

You already understand that, to achieve true health, your diet needs to be balanced and nutritious and you need to get a good amount of exercise. Sadly, there isn't constantly enough time or energy for us to really do the things we want to do. At the end of the day, most of us want to go home, not to the gym. People crave salty and sweet, not veggies (unless they are vegetarians). You will be happy to discover that becoming healthy doesn't have to be hard. If you are diligent you'll get all of the activity and appropriate food choices you need. Here are some very simple ways to get healthy.

Run the stairs. Rather than using an elevator, climb up the stairs to the floor you live or work on. This isn't as simple to do if you work on a very high floor but if you work on a lower floor, using the stairs is a superb way to get some extra exercise. Even if you do live or work on one of the top floors, you can still get out of the elevator first and climb up the stairs the rest of the way. Most people will choose to be idle and take an elevator instead of opting for exercise on the stairs. That just one flight of stairs—when taken a several times a day—can be just the extra boost that your system needs. 

There are all sorts of things that you can do to get healthy. An overpriced gym membership and very restrictive diets are not the only way to do it. Little things, when done every single day, can do plenty to make it easier to get healthy and lose pounds. Being smart when you choose your food and actions is where it begins. A proper amount of physical activity each day is also critical. Remember: being healthy and balanced isn’t just about reducing your weight. You really want your body to be powerful too.
